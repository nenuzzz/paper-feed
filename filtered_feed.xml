Abstract: In this work, using theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory, taking into account the dispersive VDW interaction, the processes of adsorption and interaction of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface in various configurations are investigated. At the atomic/molecular level, the interactions of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface have been studied for various orientations. The results of calculations within the framework of DFT+ VDW show that the adsorption energies of single water molecules in different initial positions on the substrate surface vary from-0.72 to-0.84 eV, and the most stable adsorbate structure is the TiO2+ H2O system upon adsorption of a molecule of water, parallel to the Y axis, because during the adsorption of H2O parallel to the Y axis, some favorable effects are observed in the band structure of titanium dioxide. On the one hand, the band gap decreases to 2.59 eV, and on the other hand, a new energy state appears in the band gap with an energy contribution of 0.17 eV, when water is physisorbed and interacts with a titanium atom at a distance of 2.12 {\AA} and occupies a perpendicular position relative to the surface.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02431v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous Collision of Exceptional Points on Nonorientable Manifolds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02442</link><description>arXiv:2601.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band degeneracies, ranging from Hermitian Dirac points to non-Hermitian exceptional points (EPs), play a central role in topological phase transitions. Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements. Our findings identify nonorientability as a new arena for engineering band degeneracies and topological phases, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the interplay between exceptional and nonorientable topology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strain effects on the binding and diffusion energies of Au adatoms and CeO2 admolcules on Au, CeO2, MgO and SrTiO3 surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02450</link><description>arXiv:2601.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study the effects of elastic strains on the binding and diffusion activation energies of Au adatom and CeO2 admolecule on Au (001), Ce-terminated CeO2 (001), MgO (001), SrO- and TiO2-terminationed SrTiO3 (001) surfaces. In preparation for computing these energies, normal and shear strains within the range 0.15% were applied in the plane of the surface of the supercell prior to placing the adsorbed species on the surface. Our study shows that the dependence of binding energies and diffusion barriers of adatoms and molecules on the strain varies significantly among surfaces. The strain was found to alter the symmetry of surface diffusion pathways causing anisotropy of the diffusion barriers. This strain-induced anisotropy depends on the orientation of the applied strains relative to the in-plane crystallographic directions of the free surface. The binding and diffusion activation energies were fit linearly in terms of strain components in the range 0.15% and the extrapolated values compared favorably to DFT computed values up to 0.5%. The scheme presented here for the computation and fitting of the binding and diffusion energies in terms of strain can be used to inform models of surface diffusion, clustering and growth of multi-component and multi-phase thin films and investigate the effect of strain on the self-organization in such systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02450v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic band structure reconstruction in Ni$_{x}$ZrTe$_{2}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02647</link><description>arXiv:2601.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The filling of the large van der Waals gap in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) often leads to lattice and electronic instabilities, which prelude the onset of a rich phenomenology. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of the TMDs ZrTe$_2$ and Ni-intercalated ZrTe$_2$ (Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, $x\approx 0.05$) employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We readily identify in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$ two flat bands, most likely associated with localized Ni-derived 3$d$-states, at about $\approx-0.7$ eV and $\approx-1.2$ eV in binding energy. The presence of these flat bands is observed for all temperatures ($T$) in our study. More significantly, at low-$T$, we identify an electronic structure reconstruction in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, which halves the electronic periodicity along the $k_{z}$ direction. This is reminiscent of a commensurate band folding with wave-vector $q=(0,0,\pi)$. Together with previous results from macroscopic measurements, namely heat capacity and resistivity, our findings suggest that Ni intercalation drives a structural instability at $T^{*}=287$ K, which causes the observed electronic band reconstruction. Our findings invite further investigation into the structural properties of ZrTe$_2$ and of the intercalated and defect-engineered versions of this material.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Realization of a universal topological waveguide by tuning adiabatic geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02658</link><description>arXiv:2601.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum valley Hall-based topological phases have been attracting attention across diverse fields as a robust platform for wave guidance due to their high compatibility with engineering frameworks. Combining three representative boundary types enables topological waveguides with flexible designability and enhanced functionality. However, one of the three, namely the armchair boundary, has long been limited by inter-valley scattering, resulting in weak topological protection and severely restricting its use in practical devices. This long-standing constraint is a major barrier to realizing broadly applicable topological waveguide systems. Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^{\deg} and 150^{\deg}-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02658v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal coarsening of a two-dimensional Bose gas under conservative evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02687</link><description>arXiv:2601.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase ordering dynamics of a uniform two-dimensional Bose gas quenched to a finite temperature in the superfluid phase. Starting from a defect-rich, far-from-equilibrium state, we model the subsequent evolution with the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which conserves both energy and particle number. By tuning the initial energy, we control the effective post-quench temperature and examine its role in the equilibration dynamics. We find that the gas exhibits universal behaviour at all temperatures, evidenced by spatio-temporal scaling of correlation functions and power-law growth of the correlation length $\sim t^{1/z}$, with $z$ the dynamical critical exponent. We find $z$ to be temperature dependent, with $z \approx 1.5$ for post-quench temperatures just below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and $z \approx 1.9$ for quenches to near-zero temperature. Analysis of the Porod tail of the momentum distribution suggests a temperature-dependent competition between vortices and sound waves in the coarsening process. The two-time correlation function also exhibits universal scaling, decaying as $\sim t^{-\lambda/z}$, with autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Near the BKT transition we obtain $\lambda \approx 2$, whereas $\lambda$ is found to diverge as the effective temperature approaches zero.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anisotropic Kinetics of Ion-Irradiation-Induced Phase Transition in Gallium Oxide</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02770</link><description>arXiv:2601.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-tolerant semiconductors have traditionally been engineered by the principle of suppressing defect accumulation and amorphization, based on the assumption that radiation damage is inherently stochastic. Here we show that, in monoclinic $\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3}, a promising ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor, surface crystallographic orientation deterministically governs radiation tolerance through highly anisotropic kinetics of the $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ phase transition. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics coupled with a local configurational-entropy descriptor, we quantitatively map anisotropic $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ transition kinetics, showing that the critical dose, transition-layer depth, and kinetic stability of the $\gamma$-phase are fundamentally governed by surface orientation. Under ion irradiation, non-channeling surfaces such as (100), (001), and (-201) undergo severe surface amorphization, whereas the strongly channeling (010) surface resists damage accumulation and promotes subsurface $\gamma$-phase nucleation. During thermal annealing recovery process, these initial states follow two distinct recovery pathways: the channeling (010) surface reverts directly from $\gamma$-to-$\beta$, whereas non-channeling surfaces follow a sequential amorphous-to-$\gamma$-to-$\beta$ transition pathway. This work establishes surface orientation as a fundamental design principle for achieving radiation tolerance through controlled polymorphic transitions, providing a universal framework for engineering functional materials capable of withstanding extreme irradiation environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transformation Journey of Zr-based MOFs: Study on Mechanics and Hydrogen Storage under Doping Regulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02794</link><description>arXiv:2601.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the transformation journey of Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), focusing on enhancing their mechanical properties and hydrogen storage capacities through doping regulation. MOFs, a versatile class of crystalline porous materials, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad potential applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, and sensing. Among them, Zr-based MOFs stand out for their exceptional stability and high surface area. This research systematically investigates six key Zr-based MOFs (UIO-66, UIO-67, UIO-68, MOF-801, MOF-802, and MOF-841) using multiscale computational methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT). The study explores the impact of metal ion substitution (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) on the mechanical and hydrogen storage properties of these MOFs. Our findings reveal that metal ion substitution significantly influences the mechanical stability and hydrogen adsorption capacity of Zr-based MOFs, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance MOF materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02794v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interface-induced band bending and charge separation in all-organic ZnPc/F$_x$ZnPc heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03167</link><description>arXiv:2601.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors are attractive building blocks for electronic devices due to their low cost and flexibility. Furthermore, heterostructures with type-II band alignments can efficiently separate photogenerated charges via a charge transfer and separation process.
  Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate model interfaces formed by zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and its fluorinated derivatives (F$_8$ZnPc and F$_{16}$ZnPc). We demonstrate that these interfaces not only exhibit a type-II band offset, but also band bending. The band bending causes both the LUMO and HOMO states to localize away from the interface. Therefore, the band bending creates a strong driving force for charge separation. We used ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) to experimentally confirm this predicted band bending. The wavefunction envelopes of vertically-stacked molecules resemble particle-in-a-box states, but this shape is lost when the molecules are staggered.
  These results elucidate how interface-induced band bending facilitates charge separation in all-organic heterostructures and suggest a design pathway toward improved performance in organic photovoltaic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03167v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emulating 2D Materials with Magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03210</link><description>arXiv:2601.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03210v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Restoring Bloch's Theorem for Cavity Exciton Polaron-Polaritons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03230</link><description>arXiv:2601.03230v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in the field of nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.17223v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transforming Acidic Corrosion and Embrittlement into a Hydrogen-Trapping Cage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05481</link><description>arXiv:2506.05481v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vision of a hydrogen economy demands efficient platforms to close the gap between sustainable proton sources and solid-state hydrogen carriers. Metal hydrides serve as key carriers, yet their synthesis remains constrained by the energy-intensive use of high-pressure H2, which fragments the hydrogen chain. Here, we overturn this paradigm by transforming two classic degradation mechanisms, acidic corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, into a constructive materials-design strategy. We demonstrate that synergistic control of these processes in acid enables the in-situ engineering of a "hydrogen-trapping cage" (HTC) microstructure within metals. Composed of a dense defect network, this cage directly captures and stabilizes protons as hydrides under mild conditions, guided by the universal criterion |DeltaPeq| &gt; DeltaPph. Using this platform, we synthesize over 20 hydrides, including challenging targets such as LiH and NaH, and showcase its functional power with a cage-rich titanium hydride electrocatalyst. This catalyst achieves an exceptional current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, attributed to rapid H- transport within the engineered cage. This work establishes a transformative "failure-to-function" paradigm, delivering an integrated platform that unifies hydrogen capture, stabilization, and conversion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05481v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pseudopotentials for Orbital-Free DFT: Capturing Nonlocality and Correcting Functional Approximants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19892</link><description>arXiv:2511.19892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.19892v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritiated graphene: combining nuclear quantum mechanics with Density Functional Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13259</link><description>arXiv:2504.13259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.13259v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07974</link><description>arXiv:2512.07974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are violated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and duality defects in detail for the Ising model, and find agreement with all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07974v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Thermotropic liquid-assisted interface management enables efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and modules</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68231-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this work, Chang et al. report a thermotropic liquid additive for perovskite solar cells that enables dynamic interface management, simultaneously passivating defects and suppressing ion migration to deliver high efficiency and substantially enhanced operational stability.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Lightdriven proton-coupled two-electron ligand reduction causes the rearrangement of the coordination sphere in Cu(I) 4H-imidazolato complexes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b8lbh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The direct conversion of solar light into chemical energy, inspired by natural photosynthesis, presents a promising strat-egy for energy storage and chemical transformations. We investigate this approach using photoactive Cu(I) complexes with the functional 4H-imidazolato ligand for storage of multiple photoredox equivalents. This study demonstrates that these complexes undergo light-driven reduction under a variety of reaction conditions involving different irradiation wavelengths, solvents, and elec-tron/proton donors. We used single-crystal X-ray analysis together with NMR spectroscopy to characterize the isolated photore-duction product. This analysis supports a proton-coupled two-electron transfer mechanism and reveals a significant structural trans-formation of the complex. By employing UV-Vis spectroscopy alongside DFT calculations, we elucidated the mechanisms underlying the photoreduction process, including protonation of both exocyclic nitrogen atoms at the chelating binding site as consequence of the two electron reduction, resulting in the migration of the Cu(I) bisphosphine fragment from the chelating binding site of the imidazolato ligand to form a trigonal-planar Cu(I) 1H-imidazolato complex. This rearrangement drastically changes the shape of the molecule, exposing an additional binding site on the Cu(I) center and making the N,N binding site available for subsequent reactions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b8lbh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Quantum mechanical calculations on Ensartinib drug</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-fr4rn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ensartinib is a next-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, recently approved for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Substituting Sc at the Al sites provides an effective means to tune these barriers, significantly lowering the energy cost of polarization reversal and enabling controllable ferroelectric performance for targeted applications. Furthermore, the ultrathin films exhibit strong in-plane piezoelectric responses, which are further enhanced by Sc alloying. These results highlight Sc-doped w-AlN layers as a promising platform for low-dimensional ferroelectric and piezoelectric devices.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-hd926?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Making excited state MD faster: extrapolation of transition densities for TD-DFT calculations</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mqwxc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Excited state molecular dynamics simulations are a powerful computational tool for the study of photoinduced phenomena. These are often used in conjunction with linear response TD-DFT to get the excited state energy and its gradients. At each step of an MD simulation, the new molecular geometry is relatively close to the previous ones, suggesting that some extrapolation strategy can be applied, such that the results of the previous calculations, which are available for free, can be used to predict the result of the upcoming calculation. The prediction can then be used as a guess for the iterative solver to lower the number of iterations and thus the cost. In this contribution, we present an extension of the Grassmann extrapolation scheme (GExt) to linear response TD-DFT, in which the knowledge about the manifold structure to which the solutions belong is used to make the extrapolation more accurate. The new extrapolation strategy is then tested on four systems showing a significant acceleration of the excited state molecular dynamics.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mqwxc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Retraining and evaluating EquiformerV2 machine-learning potentials for global optimization of Mo2C nanoclusters</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-xcsp0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nanoclusters enriched in coordinatively unsaturated metal sites usually exhibit distinct geometric and electronic properties and outperform bulk catalysts.

Abstract: Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Chemically Grounded Evaluation Framework for Generative Models in Materials Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00886</link><description>arXiv:2601.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Visualization of Excitonic Pair Breaking at Individual Impurities in Ta2Pd3Te5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01096</link><description>arXiv:2601.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic insulators host the condensates of bound electron-hole pairs, offering a platform for studying correlated bosonic quantum states. Yet, how macroscopic coherence emerges from locally collapsed pairing remains elusive. Here, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we report the impurity-induced pair breaking in an excitonic insulator Ta2Pd3Te5. Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states. These observations, together with mean-field modelling, suggest an excitonic pair-breaking origin. In the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, a secondary pair-breaking effect, manifesting as an additional pair of subgap states with distinctly lower energies, can emerge, presenting the interplay of pairing breakings with different excitonic order parameters. Our findings demonstrate the spectroscopic 'fingerprint' of local excitonic depairing at the atomic level, offering a crucial clue to the critical behavior across excitonic condensation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Coherent B2 Stability in Ru-Containing Refractory Alloys Through Thermodynamic Elastic Design Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01326</link><description>arXiv:2601.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tripling of the Superconducting Critical Current Density in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ Retained After Pressure Release</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01328</link><description>arXiv:2601.01328v1 Announce Type: new

Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $\delta \kappa$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $\delta T_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of pressure cycling for improving $J_c$, which may offer a simpler alternative to approaches such as chemical doping or the introduction of artificial pinning centers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular simulation of methane hydrate growth confined into a silica pore</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01329</link><description>arXiv:2601.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of a methane hydrate seed within a silica slit pore of fixed width has been studied using AllAtom Molecular Dynamics (AA-MD). An AA force field has been used to describe the molecules of the solid silica substrate, with a-quartz crystalline structure. The crystallisation of hydrates in confined geometries is not well understood yet, and the objective of this work is to study the hydrate growth inside a silica pore using molecular simulation. Both NVT and NpT ensembles were used in the AA-MD simulations to analyse the hydrate growth from an initial seed. Results showed that the boundary conditions imposed by the nanometric slit pore yielded a hydrate with structural defects, filling the accessible space between the silica walls. The water molecules which were not incorporated to the initial seed hydrate formed a high density water layer trapped between the silica walls and the crystallised hydrate. These results provide an interesting insight into the hydrate crystallisation process in confined geometries, resembling those found in natural hydrate deposits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spontaneous growth of perfectly circular domains of MoS2 monolayers using chemical vapour deposition technique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01463</link><description>arXiv:2601.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very large-scale integration of devices in a circular pattern has several advantages over the commonly used rectangular grid layout. For the development of such integrated circuits on a 2D semiconductor platform, spontaneous growth of the material in the form of circular islands is desirable. Here, we report the natural formation of 1L-MoS2 circular islands of diameter as large as a few hundreds of micrometer on SiO2/Si substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique without the use of any seeding layer. The size of the circles is found to increase with the amount of sulphur used during growth. The study reveals that these circular islands are formed with a less-defective interior and a more-defective outer part that is dominated by a large density of grain boundaries and twists. Due to the lower defect density, the interior region yields much higher photoluminescence than the peripheral part. Field effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated on inner and outer portions of a circle to estimate the mobility and concentration of the background carriers in the two regions. The study shows that the maximum mobility is more than double in the interior than the outer part. While the carrier concentration remains practically unchanged in the two regions. The natural tendency to minimize the strain energy resulting from the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the monolayer and the substrate as well as the edge energy that originates from the boundary tension are thought to be the driving forces behind the formation of these circular domains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01463v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electrical Regulation of Transverse Spin Currents in Unconventional Magnetic Ferroeletrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01499</link><description>arXiv:2601.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify hexagonal YMnO$_3$ as a material realization of the elusive $\beta$-phase of unconventional magnetism, a noncollinear, noncoplanar antiferromagnetic state defined by intrinsic spin-momentum locking and a topological spin texture. First-principle calculations reveal that this unique electronic structure enables a perpendicular electric field to generate a transverse pure spin current, a response that occurs without requiring relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Symmetry analysis demonstrates that this spin current is intimately related to the material's ferroelectric polarization that breaks the inversion symmetry and is rigorously forbidden at domain walls where electrical polarization vanishes. This provides a blueprint for a non-volatile transistor where a gate voltage switches the spin current conductivity by controlling domain wall density, enabling all-electrical control for energy-efficient antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Band-Edge Carrier Trapping Limits Light Emission in WSe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01529</link><description>arXiv:2601.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit bright photoluminescence, a desirable property for light-emitting diodes and single-photon emitters. Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two-Qubit Module Based on Phonon-Coupled Ge Hole-Spin Qubits: Design, Fabrication, and Readout at 1-4 K</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01704</link><description>arXiv:2601.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a device-level design for a two-qubit module based on phonon-coupled germanium (Ge) hole-spin qubits operating at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Building on prior work on phonon-engineered Ge qubits and phononic-crystal (PnC) cavities, we specify a lithography-ready layout that integrates two gate-defined hole-spin qubits in a strained Ge quantum well with a GHz PnC defect mode that mediates a coherent phonon-based interaction. We detail the SiGe/Ge heterostructure, PnC cavity design, and a compatible nanofabrication process flow, including the gate stack, membrane patterning and release, and RF/DC wiring. We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocations, vacancies and interstitials in the two-dimensional one-component plasma</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01809</link><description>arXiv:2601.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energetics and stability of dislocations, vacancies and, interstitials in the one-component plasma (OCP), where the charges interact with a log potential and move on the curved surface of a cylinder have been investigated numerically. For vacancy-interstitial pairs, the log term of the direct Coulomb attraction and the elastic displacement energy cancel exactly at long distances, resulting in a defect energy of O(1). The numerical results confirm the predicted asymptotic behavior but also identify critical distances below which pairs evolve to different forms. We have found that bound pairs of dislocations - created by adding or removing 120 degree zig-zags of particles - have a dependence on their preparation history which is not accounted for in the usual starting point of the KTHNY theory. Furthermore, isolated dislocations, whose presence disrupts crystalline order, have energies of O(1) at some values of N, the number of particles in the system, and therefore will be thermally excited, raising questions about the applicability of standard KTHNY theory to the OCP, and supporting older suggestions that there are no phase transitions at all in the two-dimensional OCP.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906</link><description>arXiv:2601.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Score-based diffusion models for accurate crystal-structure inpainting and reconstruction of hydrogen positions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01959</link><description>arXiv:2601.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge disproportionation as a possible mechanism towards polar antiferromagnetic metal in molecular orbital crystal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02048</link><description>arXiv:2601.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Design of Defect States in Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Telecommunication-Band Quantum Emission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02068</link><description>arXiv:2601.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect-based single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising platforms for integrated quantum photonics; however, the absence of identified emitters operating at telecom wavelengths remains a critical limitation for fiber-based quantum communication. Here, we investigate previously unexplored carbon- and silicon-based point defects in monolayer h-BN as SPE candidates using hybrid density functional theory, constrained excited-state relaxations, and a generating-function approach to photoluminescence. We compute zero-phonon-line (ZPL) energies, radiative lifetimes, Huang-Rhys (HR) factors, and photoluminescence lineshapes to screen optical performance. All defects are thermodynamically stable with negative formation energies, and five candidates exhibit moderate electron-phonon coupling (HR &lt; 5), indicating narrow emission linewidths. These emitters span a broad spectral range from the visible to the telecom regime, including near-infrared C-based centers and, most notably, the Si2BVN defect, which is identified as the first point defect in monolayer h-BN predicted to support single-photon emission in the telecom C band (1554 nm). Vacancy-containing complexes possess spin-1/2 ground states, enabling spin-photon interfaces compatible with integrated photonic and cavity-based platforms. The combined analysis of ZPL energies, electron-phonon coupling, and radiative lifetimes provides concrete targets for experimental realization of spin-active single-photon emitters in h-BN from the visible to telecom wavelengths.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Competing phases and domain structures of ferroelectric perovskites: the benefit of epitaxial (110) growth</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02118</link><description>arXiv:2601.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain and domain engineering offer powerful routes to control phase and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films. While most studies have focused on (100)-oriented growth, the impact of lower-symmetry orientations remains underexplored. We address this gap in knowledge with first-principles based molecular dynamics simulation for the example of prototypical ferroelectric perovskites under (110) strain. Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic stress response kernels for dislocations and cracks: unified anisotropic Lagrangian formulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02124</link><description>arXiv:2601.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastodynamic cohesive-zone models for defects such as cracks or dislocations (such as the Geubelle-Rice model for cracks, or the Dynamic Peierls Equation for flat-core dislocations), feature the same stress-response convolution kernel in space and time. It accounts for in-plane elastic wave propagation, while its associated instantaneous radiative term accounts for radiative losses in the surrounding medium. These objects are well-known for isotropic elasticity, with their space-time representations involving generalized functions. For anisotropic elasticity they were unknown. The paper presents a derivation using the Stroh formalism. Their Fourier representation rests exclusively on the so-called prelogarithmic Lagrangian factor $L(v)$, while their space-time form involves its derivative $p(v)=L'(v)$, the prelogarithmic impulsion function. A straightforward consequence is the reformulation of the stress in the Weertman model of steadily-moving dislocations in terms of $L(v)$. Special care being paid to the causality constraint, the theory covers indifferently subsonic, intersonic and supersonic regimes of motion. The theory proposed is suitable to phase-field-type Fourier-based numerical codes for planar systems of defects in anisotropic elastodynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the Static Kuhn Length: Conformational Substructures and Relaxation Dynamics in Flexible Chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02127</link><description>arXiv:2601.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical "monomer-based" segment length $b$ and the Kuhn length $l_k$ are central to polymer physics, yet the minimal size required for a truly statistical segment - Gaussian, uncorrelated, and valid as an entropic spring - is not rigorously established. Using atomistic simulations of entangled polyethylene, we re-evaluate these foundational quantities.
  By fitting end-to-end distance distributions of C--C bond blocks and validating with higher-moment analyses, we identify for the first time the minimal sizes corresponding to a statistical segment and an entropic spring. A single Kuhn segment (approximately 11 bonds) is the smallest statistically uncorrelated unit, but its distance distribution is strongly non-Gaussian, while the monomer-based segment $b$, used in rheology and classical tube-theory formulations, is not statistical at all. True Gaussianity emerges only for blocks containing multiple Kuhn segments.
  At the Kuhn scale, we uncover a previously unresolved conformational heterogeneity. Each segment samples a broad range of conformations, from coiled (approximately 4~\AA) to extended (approximately 14~\AA), giving rise to three distinct substructures: aligned chain segments (ACS), random conformational sequences (RCS), and chain ends (CE). These exhibit distinct dynamical signatures. ACS relax with a stretched-exponential exponent $\beta \approx 0.5$, consistent with quasi-one-dimensional, defect-mediated localized modes, whereas RCS and CE relax with $\beta \approx 0.7$. By connecting these results to localized-mode theory and continuous-time random-walk models, we provide a molecular interpretation of stretched-exponential relaxation in polymer melts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02127v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Morphology dependent decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation of Cr$_2$AlC coatings revealed by correlative tomography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02216</link><description>arXiv:2601.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative 3D characterization of materials degradation in oxidizing environments remains limited. Here, we apply a correlative tomography-based mass balance framework to Cr$_2$AlC, a coating candidate for accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings and turbine blades, and show that decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation, quantified by integrating volumetric, structural and compositional data, are strongly governed by grain morphology. The oxidation of sputtered Cr$_2$AlC coatings with equiaxed and columnar grain morphologies was analyzed. While Cr$_7$C$_3$ formed in both coating morphologies, pores formed exclusively in columnar coatings. The expected Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume was estimated by mass-balance calculations assuming that Al-deintercalation enables oxide scale and Al-O-C-N precipitate formation, leading to complete transformation of the Al-deintercalated Cr$_2$AlC into Cr$_7$C$_3$. In equiaxed coatings, the predicted carbide volume agreed with tomography within 3 $\pm$ 3 %, confirming Al-deintercalation-driven Cr$_7$C$_3$ formation. Despite the smaller molar volume of Cr$_7$C$_3$ relative to Cr$_2$AlC, absence of pores imply that transformation shrinkage is likely accommodated by coating thickness reduction. In columnar coatings, the predicted Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume exceeds the measured value by 22 $\pm$ 4 %, and the pore volume expected from transformation shrinkage alone is 13-16 % lower than measured, indicating partial Al deintercalation and clustering of pre-existing defects. This combined methodology provides a general route to quantitatively resolve degradation mechanisms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic correlations and topology in Kondo insulator PuB$_6$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02312</link><description>arXiv:2601.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a combination of dynamical mean field theory and density functional theory (DMFT/DFT), it has been theoretically proposed that PuB$_6$ is a strongly correlated topological insulator characterized by nontrivial $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ topological invariants and metallic surface states (\textit{X. Deng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 176404 (2013)}). Here, we demonstrate through low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and first-principles calculations that PuB$6$ exhibits characteristics of a topological Kondo insulating state. These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($\Delta{\rho} \sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02312v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Selective Imperfection as a Generative Framework for Analysis, Creativity and Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00863</link><description>arXiv:2601.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00863v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Analog Weight Update Rule in Ferroelectric Hafnia, using pico-Joule Programming Pulses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01186</link><description>arXiv:2601.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effort to compete with the brain's efficiency at processing information, neuromorphic hardware combines artificial synapses and neurons using mixed-signal circuits and emerging memories. In ferroelectric resistive weights, the strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons is stored in the device conductance. During learning, programming pulses are applied to the synaptic weight, which reconfigures the ferroelectric domains and adjusts the conductance. One strategy to lower the energy cost during the training phase is to lower the duration of the programming pulses. However, the latter cannot be shorter than the self-loading time of the resistive weights, limited by intrinsic parasitics in the circuits. In this work, ferroelectric resistive weights are fabricated using a process compatible with CMOS Back-End-Of-Line integration, based on hafnia/zirconia nanolaminates. By laterally scaling the device area under 100 $\mu$m$^2$, the self-loading time becomes sufficiently short to enable 20 ns programming, which corresponds to a maximum of 3 picoJoules per pulse. Further, in this work, the weight update rule with 20 ns pulses is experimentally measured not only for different amplitudes but also for different initial conductance states. We find that the final weight is determined by the pulse amplitude, independent of the initial weight value.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theoretical Study of C36 and O@C36 Fullerene Isomers with (C1, C2, Cs, D2, D3h) symmetries: Geometry Optimization, Electrical Properties and Spectroscopic Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02041</link><description>arXiv:2601.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h &lt; C36-C1 &lt; C36-Cs &lt; C36-C2 &lt; C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Study of Dispersion-Corrected Electronic and Optical Properties of syn- and anti- B18H22 Clusters with/without Sulfur Doping for Tunable Optoelectronics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02049</link><description>arXiv:2601.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation of the electronic and excited-state properties of syn- and anti-isomers of the borane cluster B18H22 and their sulfur-doped derivatives.
  Using the PB86/def2-SVP level of theory with dispersion corrections, the research examines how sulfur substitution and non-covalent interactions influence cluster stability, electronic structure, spectra, and optoelectronic potential. Comparative analysis of the syn- and anti-isomers reveals the impact of molecular conformation on frontier molecular orbitals and related energetic and photophysical properties. Sulfur doping is shown to enhance charge delocalization, stabilize excited states, and improve thermal stability, which form key factors for tunable laser applications.
  The inclusion of advanced dispersion correction methods proves essential for accurately capturing many-body interactions that govern electronic behavior. By elucidating the interplay between structural features, substitution patterns, and computational modeling, the work provides valuable insights into structure-property relationships critical for designing borane-based materials with tailored optoelectronic and thermal characteristics. In addition to doping and dispersion effects, functionals' effects were examined through comparison amidst various ones with different asymptotic exchange on excitation and gap energies. In summary, the computational methodology combined good DFT/Basis/dispersion set to accurately predict geometries, IR/UV spectra, NMR chemical shifts, dipole moments, polarizability and excited-state properties, thereby offering a comprehensive theoretical understanding of syn-, anti- isomers of B18H22 and its sulfur doped variants.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase transitions in a three dimensional $U(1) \times U(1)$ lattice London superconductor: Metallic superfluid and charge-4e superconducting states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3311</link><description>arXiv:1006.3311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional lattice $U(1) \times U(1)$ and $[U(1)]^N$ superconductors in the London limit, with individually conserved condensates. The $U(1) \times U(1)$ problem, generically, has two types of intercomponent interactions of different characters. First, the condensates are interacting via a minimal coupling to the same fluctuating gauge field. A second type of coupling is the direct dissipationless drag represented by a local intercomponent current-current coupling term in the free energy functional. In this work, we present a study of the phase diagram of a $U(1) \times U(1)$ superconductor which includes both of these interactions. We study phase transitions and two types of competing paired phases which occur in this general model: (i) a metallic superfluid phase (where there is order only in the gauge invariant phase difference of the order parameters), (ii) a composite superconducting phase where there is order in the phase sum of the order parameters which has many properties of a single-component superconductor but with a doubled value of electric charge. We investigate the phase diagram with particular focus on what we call ``preemptive phase transitions.'' These are phase transitions unique to multicomponent condensates with competing topological objects. A sudden proliferation of one kind of topological defects may come about due to a fluctuating background of topological defects in other sectors of the theory. For $U(1) \times U(1)$ theory with unequal bare stiffnesses where components are coupled by a non-compact gauge field only, we study how this scenario leads to a merger of two $U(1)$ transitions into a single $U(1) \times U(1)$ discontinuous phase transition. We also report a general form of vortex-vortex bare interaction potential and possible phase transitions in an $N$-component London superconductor with individually conserved condensates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1006.3311v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-dependent Transport Studies of Fe/Mo$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S$_2$/Fe Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16440</link><description>arXiv:2504.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin dependent electron transport in Fe/Mo$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S$_2$/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and with substitutional doping of 3d transition metal Cr at Mo site in MoS2 is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows the presence of metal-induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2/Fe interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunnelling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity Cr, the tunnelling magnetoresistance for 7-layer junction is reduced. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band, and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. Spin-transport through close-packed Fe(111) surface as electrode show low GMR value.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.16440v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Higher critical currents yet faster vortex creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing coherent artificial pinning centers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01119</link><description>arXiv:2507.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices -- magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO$_3$ inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density $J_c$ based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing high concentrations of BaHfO$_3$. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO$_3$ increases creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ even while concomitantly improving $J_c$. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that $J_c$ is maximized at the BaHfO$_3$ concentration that hosts creep of large vortex bundles or a Bose glass state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01119v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing the band structure of the strongly correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3 across its phase transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14890</link><description>arXiv:2507.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.14890v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link><description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23783v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theoretical Investigation of Performance-Improved Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction Based on Trap-Assisted Tunneling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12879</link><description>arXiv:2508.12879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges that hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the simulated TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high current density and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12879v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic structures and superconductivity in Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08194</link><description>arXiv:2510.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08194v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discrete Shift and Polarization from Response to Symmetry Defects in Interacting Topological Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19483</link><description>arXiv:2510.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the previous study of extracting crystalline symmetry-protected topological invariants to the correlated regime.

Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23514v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link><description>arXiv:2512.23364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23364v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Melting curve of correlated iron at Earth's core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25061</link><description>arXiv:2512.25061v2 Announce Type: replace

Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25061v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link><description>arXiv:2601.00744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00744v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04321</link><description>arXiv:2508.04321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04321v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Bright Insights into Luminescent Nickel(II): Exploring Ligand Rigidity and Ultrafast Deactivation Pathways via Theory and Experiment</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dg8w0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In this work, we elucidate the origin of the unique luminescence of a square-planar 3d nickel(II) complex, [Ni(L−CH3)], and explain its quenching in the differently substituted [Ni(L−CF3)] through a combination of high-level multiconfigurational wave function methods and transient absorption spectroscopy. The strong agreement between computed activation barriers and experimental kinetic data validates the predicted deactivation mechanisms. In addition, the new theoretical results prompted a re-evaluation of experimental UV–vis absorption spectra published earlier by some of us. The updated analysis reveals a previously overlooked, concentration-dependent oligomerization of [Ni(L−CH3)], which accounts for the complexity of the visible absorption envelope. We uncover a delicate energetic balance between competing relaxation pathways that renders non-radiative deactivating electronic states inaccessible for the −CH3 complex, yet accessible in its −CF3 analog. In addition to common metal-centered triplet and singlet states, we have identified a class of excited states that are crucial for the differing photoactivity of the two species. These states arise from antiferromagnetic coupling of two local triplet states, metal and ligand, into an overall singlet.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were combined to correlate grain orientation and surface morphology changes with experimental conditions that drive shape formation. Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive voltammetric analysis across a broad range of stepped single-crystal electrodes, demonstrating that blank cyclic voltammograms in NaCl effectively decouple terrace and step contributions on copper. Our results revealed that while chloride tends to form structures comprising (100) terraces and (111) or (110) defects when oxidation-reduction pulses are applied to refacet copper, the deposition rate, determined by the ER, controls the length of the created (100) terraces and defect density. The oxidation and reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated as model structure-sensitive reactions to probe how variations in the terrace-to-defect ratio affect catalytic behavior. Low-coordinated sites promote oxidation of HMF, whereas (100) terraces adjacent to steps lower the onset potential for HMF reduction. By identifying the active surface facets, this work demonstrates that surface structure engineering is a powerful approach to advance electrocatalysis on copper.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-m2khp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Probing Molecular Organization in Polar Nematic Phases: A Combined FTIR Spectroscopy and Molecular Simulation Approach</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9bf98?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However,
the relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting
macroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using
a combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S ≈ 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase. This study demonstrates that the unique properties of polar nematics are governed by specific molecular self-assembly and establishes phase biaxiality as a key feature
of these systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9bf98?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene heterostructure</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68072-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 06 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68072-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68072-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This study shows that electrically switchable and non-volatile dipoles can form at the interface of graphene and α-RuCl3 when separated by an ultrathin hBN layer.

Results show that J–V characteristics exhibit a reduction in turn-on voltage and an evident enhancement in forward current density along with an increase in carrier concentration, induced by irradiation. In combination with deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) characterization, it is observed that an evolution of intrinsic defects is primarily related to proton-implantation. In transient spectra, the strength of peak E1 (Ec − 0.46 eV) is significantly reduced, while that of peak E2 (Ec − 0.60 eV) is enhanced. Therefore, the evolution of defects is inevitably attributed to the energy loss and dynamic collision of incident protons, which is supported by the characterization of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Based on our built-in defect database of β-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, it is inferred that E1 represents divacancy V&lt;sub&gt;GaII&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;OII&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;GaI&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;OI&lt;/sub&gt; and E2 represents trivacancy V&lt;sub&gt;GaII&lt;/sub&gt; − 2V&lt;sub&gt;OII&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;GaI&lt;/sub&gt; − 2V&lt;sub&gt;OII&lt;/sub&gt;, or V&lt;sub&gt;GaI&lt;/sub&gt; − 2V&lt;sub&gt;OIII&lt;/sub&gt;. Because of a much deeper charge transition level for majority carriers far from conduction band, DLTS cannot detect the carrier release of hydrogen-passivated gallium vacancies at finite temperature. We found that low-energy proton irradiation can enhance the electrical performance of β-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SBDs, whose physical mechanism is clearly elucidated through hydrogen-promoted defect evolution.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/013501/3376412/Performance-enhancement-and-defect-evolution-in</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Quenching-induced polar state transformation and enhanced electromechanical response in BNT-Mn single crystals</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/012901/3376411/Quenching-induced-polar-state-transformation-and</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Ultra-fast cooling at high temperatures provides a promising strategy for enhancing the thermal stability of (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based (BNT) relaxor ferroelectrics, yet its role in tuning the polar state has been largely overlooked.

The LNQ-treated crystals exhibit a piezoelectric coefficient of 172 pC/N and a depolarization temperature of 170 °C, representing enhancements of 7 times and 95%, over the as-grown (AG) crystals.

However, the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in HZO films thicker than 20 nm remains a persistent challenge, fundamentally limiting their applications in piezoelectric transducers, pyroelectric detectors, and energy storage devices. Here, we propose a tetragonal-phase nucleation strategy guided by phase-field simulation, breaking through the thickness barrier for high-performance ferroelectric HZO films. Through a newly developed phase-field crystallization model, we first identify that a higher initial density of tetragonal-phase nuclei concurrently enhances low-temperature crystallinity and promotes the formation of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase. Furthermore, an innovative HZO (3.5 nm)/ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.5 nm) multilayer film is designed to increase tetragonal-phase nucleation density. The 54-nm-thick film annealed at an unprecedentedly low temperature of 400 °C exhibits a high fraction of ferroelectric phase and excellent ferroelectric properties. Notably, it achieves a remanent polarization significantly exceeding that of sub-20-nm-thick HZO films prepared by conventional processes.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stable spin textures, have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in information storage and processing. They are typically stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the presence of a magnetic field and can be manipulated by electric fields in magnetoelectric systems. Here we investigate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the behavior of skyrmions in a classical Heisenberg magnetoelectric model on the square lattice under combined magnetic and electric fields. We analyze spin and dipolar textures, structure factors, magnetization, chirality, and polarization for different field directions and magnitudes, identifying ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, spiral, skyrmion crystal, skyrmion gas, and bimeron phases, as well as the field-induced transitions between them. We find that the competition between electric and magnetic fields can destroy or transform skyrmion lattices into skyrmion-gas or bimeron phases. While magnetic fields induce chiral phases even in the presence of an electric field, electric fields strongly reshape the chiral region and deform skyrmion textures. This reciprocal influence between magnetic and electric orders reflects the intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling characteristic of multiferroic materials. Specifically, we observe the simultaneous sudden growth in magnetization with a switch-off in the polarization, typically observed in experiments. In this context, localized magnetoelectric entities, such as skyrmions carrying electric quadrupoles, exemplify the intertwined nature of spin and charge degrees of freedom, providing a microscopic basis for the control of topological states in ME systems and their potential use in spintronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Mechanisms of Li-Ion Transport Mediated by Li10GeP2S12 in Composite Solid Polyethylene Oxide Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00112</link><description>arXiv:2601.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Sampling of Boron Diffusion in Ni Alloys: Cr and Mo Effects on Bulk and Grain Boundary Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00117</link><description>arXiv:2601.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how light interstitials migrate in chemically complex alloys is essential for predicting defect dynamics and long-term stability. Here, we introduce a spectral sampling framework to quantify boron diffusion activation energies in Ni and demonstrate how substitutional solutes (Cr, Mo) reshape interstitial point defect transport in both the bulk and along crystallographic defects. In the bulk, boron migration energy distributions exhibit distinct modality tied to solute identity and spatial arrangement: both Cr and Mo raise barriers in symmetric cages but induce directional asymmetry in partially decorated environments. Extending this framework to a $\Sigma5\langle100\rangle{210}$ symmetric tilt grain boundary reveals solute-specific confinement effects. Cr preserves low-barrier in-plane mobility while suppressing out-of-plane transport, guiding boron into favorable midplane voids. Mo, by contrast, imposes an across-the-board reduction in boron mobility, suppressing average diffusivity by two additional orders of magnitude at 800 $^\circ$C and reducing out-of-plane transport by five orders of magnitude relative to Cr. Both elements promote segregation by producing negative segregation energies, but their roles diverge: Cr facilitates rapid redistribution and stabilization at interfacial sites, consistent with Cr-rich boride formation, while Mo creates deeper and more uniform segregation wells that strongly anchor boron. Together, these complementary behaviors explain the experimental prevalence of Cr- and Mo-rich borides at grain boundaries and carbide interfaces in Ni-based superalloys. More broadly, we establish spectral sampling as a transferable framework for interpreting diffusion in disordered alloys and for designing dopant strategies that control transport across complex interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct imaging of stress tensor around single dislocation in diamond</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00261</link><description>arXiv:2601.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations are fundamental crystal defects whose stress fields govern a wide range of material properties. The analytical form of the stress tensor around single dislocation was established by elasticity theory more than 80 years ago and has provided a theoretical basis for evaluating essential characteristics of dislocations. However, direct experimental verification has long remained out of reach because it has been difficult to measure the components of the stress tensor with conventional methods. Here, we present the experimental visualization of the stress tensor around single dislocation in diamond. Using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, we mapped the shear components ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{yz}$, $\sigma_{zx}$) together with the trace of the stress tensor ($\sigma_{xx}+\sigma_{yy}+\sigma_{zz}$) around single 45{\deg} dislocation. The observed distributions exhibited good agreement with predictions from elasticity theory, thus providing experimental validation of this theoretical framework.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal History-Dependent Coalescence Mechanisms and Sintering Dynamics in Al-6.8%Cu Nanopowders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00492</link><description>arXiv:2601.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum-Copper (Al-Cu) alloys are essential materials for weight reduction critical structures in the aerospace and automotive industries, yet achieving their maximum ultrahigh-strength potential remains limited by nanoscale defect control during powder metallurgy processing. We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Al-6.8%Cu nanoparticles to explore atomic-scale mechanisms governing the full thermal sintering cycle. We demonstrate that while the sintering temperature primarily initiates neck formation, the subsequent cooling rate is the dominant kinetic parameter dictating the final microstructure. Fast cooling rates trap a significantly higher density of stacking faults and can unexpectedly lead to the formation of an amorphous phase at the interparticle interfaces, a feature critically dependent on the rate of thermal dissipation. We confirm a clear shift in the coalescence mechanism from plastic deformation (dislocation slip) at low temperatures (300 K and 450 K) to mass transport via atomic diffusion at high temperatures (600 K). These findings provide essential, atomic-scale guidelines for controlling thermal processing, particularly cooling rates, to design defect-stabilized, high-performance Al-Cu components.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00492v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Doping induced itinerant ferromagnetism and enhanced ferroelectricity in BL-InSe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00574</link><description>arXiv:2601.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in solids remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, with far-reaching implications for multifunctional materials and next-generation electronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict emergent sliding ferroelectricity and doping-mediated ferromagnetism in bilayer (BL) InSe. The energetically favored AB stacked BL-InSe spontaneously breaks the out-of-plane mirror symmetry, resulting in a switchable polarization with a saturated component of 0.089 pC/m and a low transition barrier of 28.8 meV per unit cell. Strikingly, low-concentration electrostatic doping enhances rather than suppresses the ferroelectric polarization due to the abnormal layer-dependent electronic occupation in BL-InSe, in contrast to the conventional screening paradigm. In addition, the characteristic Mexican-hat-shaped valence band enables doping-induced itinerant half-metallic ferromagnetism, where the interlayer spin density difference scales linearly with doping concentration and can be reversed by switching the polarization direction. These results demonstrate the coexistence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders in BL-InSe and establish a viable platform for realizing voltage-tunable multiferroicity through stacking and carrier doping in otherwise nonpolar and nonmagnetic semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00574v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link><description>arXiv:2601.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link><description>arXiv:2512.01884v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we map overdamped chiral flocks to a compressible vortex gas, realizing supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the radiative decay of shallow water flows.

Abstract: A new computational framework is presented to predict the structural integrity of welds in hydrogen transmission pipelines. The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi liquids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982</link><description>arXiv:2207.11982v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum XY model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two-dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moir\'{e} twisted bi-layer graphene and bilayer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear-in-temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those caused by Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature-independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2207.11982v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hydrogen storage in pristine and Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers: electronic origins, coverage effects, and finite-temperature stability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16761</link><description>arXiv:2404.16761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present a systematic first-principles study of hydrogen adsorption on pristine and Janus MX2 and MSSe monolayers (M = Ni, Pd, Pt; X = S, Se), combining density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD). Orbital-resolved electronic-structure analysis reveals that hydrogen binding strength is controlled primarily by the contribution of metal d states near the Fermi level, which increases from Pd and Pt to Ni. Chalcogen substitution from S to Se further modulates adsorption by enhancing surface polarizability. Structure plays a decisive role: metallic 1T phases promote stronger single-molecule adsorption due to enhanced electronic screening, whereas the more open coordination of the 2H phase provides greater configurational freedom at high hydrogen coverage. Janus functionalization introduces chemically inequivalent S- and Se-terminated surfaces, leading to side-dependent adsorption energies, hydrogen-layer thicknesses, and spatial distributions. Hydrogen uptake remains dominated by molecular physisorption across all systems. Finite-temperature AIMD simulations at 300 K demonstrate that hydrogen remains molecular even at high loadings, with no dissociation or irreversible chemisorption. 2H-NiSSe and 2H-PdSSe exhibit the most favorable combination of moderate adsorption energies, stable multilayer hydrogen configurations, and robust thermal stability, whereas Pt-based Janus systems display strong confinement and reduced reversibility. These results establish clear design principles for hydrogen storage in TMDs, showing that optimal performance arises from intermediate physisorption rather than maximal binding strength and highlighting Janus Ni- and Pd-based systems as promising platforms for reversible molecular hydrogen storage.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.16761v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Redox Robust Mn(I/0/-I) Dicarbenes: Electrochemistry, Steric Mapping, and Borate-Directed C-C Bond Formation</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cznhs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Manganese is perhaps the most electronically versatile element, accessing eleven different formal oxidation states (-3 to +7). However, the redox properties and reactivities of low valent monometallic Mn(0) and Mn(-I) systems remain severely underexplored due to the propensity of Mn0 to dimerize and quench high-energy metalloradicals. We report a new series of redox active monometallic Mn(I), Mn(0) and Mn(-I) complexes containing a BH2-bridged dicarbene ligand coordinated to Mn, all which have been characterized using a suite of experimental and cutting-edge computational (DFT) methods. Slow electron transfer kinetics at Mn(I/0) are observed, with computations and electrochemical simulations in excellent agreement with experiment. Despite the lack of steric bulk at the BH2-bridged Mn(0), the tBu groups at the dicarbene provide sufficient steric protection to prevent dimerization, with percent buried volume (%V_bur) serving as a steric ranking tool for to predict whether Mn(0) complexes will remain monometallic in solution. We show that when %V_bur &gt; 83% prevents dimerization for a diverse array of of Mn(0) complexes from the literature. Ligand sterics of the BPh2-bridged and BH2 bridged complexes dictate reaction outcomes when Mn(I) and Mn(-I) are exposed to nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively, while the Mn(0) metalloradicals facilitate radical cycloisomerization catalysis of 6-iodo-1-hexene at room temperature. This work underscores the importance of ligand sterics in rationalizing reactivity patterns at Mn and offers valuable insights for designing chelating ligands that can selectively leverage  Mn(I/0/-I) states in redox-mediated reactions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cznhs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Accurate and Robust Prediction of Vertical Excitation Energies  with XYG3-Type Doubly Hybrid Density Functionals</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cx0jm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The XYG3-type doubly hybrid density functionals (xDHs) have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting ground-state energies and properties. However, until now, no method has been available to compute excited states with xDHs. In this work, we propose a method that combines the second order constricted variational density functional theory [CV(2)-DFT] within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and the configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles correction [CIS(D)] method to predict vertical excitation energies using xDHs. This new black-box method, dubbed TDA-xDH, has been benchmarked against a collective dataset of 410 excitation energies. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of xDHs. For local valence and Rydberg excitations represented by 352 benchmark data points, XYGJ-OS achieves a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.08 eV, outperforming the more expensive coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method (MAD = 0.11 eV). For 30 intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) excitations, XYGJ-OS also emerges as the best performer among tested functionals, with an MAD of 0.14 eV. Furthermore, XYGJ-OS exhibits excellent performance in predicting the 1La-1Lb gap for six linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), achieving an MAD of merely 0.01 eV. A case study on HAP-3MF further reveals that xDHs are able to correctly predict the inverted singlet-triplet gap. These results highlight the great promise of xDHs for accurately predicting a wide range of molecular excitation energies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cx0jm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Perdeuteration of Arenes in Pharmaceuticals by SEAr Mechanism with Heavy Water Using pTSA Catalyst.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9fnfq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Aromatic rings are widely recognized in the realm of natural products and bioactive molecules, highlighting their importance in various applications. The development of deuterated analogues of pharmaceuticals is particularly significant in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this study, we present a novel catalytic method for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange in aromatic compounds, employing D2O as the deuterium source, which is not only easily accessible but also cost-effective. This approach demonstrates impressive deuterium incorporation under mild reaction conditions, yielding good to excellent results in a single run. Utilizing para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA) as a catalyst, this metal-free protocol exhibits broad applicability in the late-stage deuteration of a variety of bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals, and small molecules. Furthermore, our method is scalable; it has been successfully implemented at the gram-scale with a reduced catalyst loading of 2.0 mol% for Tyrosol, illustrating its practical utility. Moreover, our thorough mechanistic studies and detailed DFT studies enhance our understanding of how the catalyst and solvent contribute to the aromatic electrophilic substitution process. This innovative method provides a sustainable alternative to traditional transition metal-catalyzed H/D exchange techniques. It addresses key challenges such as the use of expensive metals, the risk of undesired reactions, and the need to remove metal impurities from products. Overall, this research enhances the efficiency and environmental friendliness of H/D exchange in aromatic compounds.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9fnfq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Multiscale modelling of the electrocatalysis of enzymes: Insights into the performance of microperoxidase at an aqueous/graphene interface and their exploitation to improve performance</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qj5fh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>There is great interest in systems where enzymes are adsorbed on and act at electrode surfaces – enzymatic biofuel cells, bioreactors and biosensors are just three examples. Whilst such systems have been the subject of extensive study and development since the 1960s, the rate of progress in this research is hindered by a lack of molecular-level understanding of the enzyme adsorption process and adsorbed states, and the associated electron transfer processes. Herein, we present and then demonstrate a multiscale approach that combines molecular dynamics simulation to elucidate the former and density functional theory (MD/DFT) for the latter. The demonstration of the new approach focused on a system involving the microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) enzyme, a microenzyme made up of a Fe-containing heme ring attached to an 11-residue scaffold, a graphene electrode, and a neutral-pH saline solution. For this system, the adsorbed MP-11 was found to adopt six possible heme configurations, where the configurations are defined by the distance of the iron from the graphene and the angle between the normals of the heme ring and graphene electrode. The rate constant for electron transfer between the MP-11 and graphene evaluated through combining the MD and DFT results and their variation with overpotential are comparable to the limited experimental data.  The results were used to illustrate how the new multiscale approach could be used to improve electrocatalytic performance of the system.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qj5fh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Mild generation of highly nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbene boryl anion from neutral sp2-sp3 diboron reagents and its applications in nucleophilic borylation</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b6rqh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Due to its high activity, the synthesis or generation of the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boryl anion remains challenging, with only limited methods available. Traditional stabilization through bulky ligands or aromatic systems restricts its reactivity as a boron synthon. In this work, we present a straightforward strategy for the in-situ generation of an NHC boryl anion at room temperature through the reaction of neutral sp2-sp3 diboron reagent (NHC)BH2Bpin with KOtBu. This less sterically hindered and strongly nucleophilic boryl anion demonstrates broad reactivity with diverse electrophiles, including those that are unreactive with other types of boryl anions or traditional diboron reagents. These nucleophilic borylation reactions enable the synthesis of a diverse array of four-coordinate organoboron compounds. Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm the intermediacy of the NHC boryl anion and provide clear insights into the reaction pathways for the newly discovered reactivities.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b6rqh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

In this work, we introduce hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene (PS–OH) as a bifunctional ligand incorporated directly during CsPbBr3 PQD synthesis. The terminal -OH groups provide strong coordination to under-coordinated Pb2+ sites, suppressing non-radiative recombination, while the polystyrene backbone forms a protective hydrophobic shell. This dual action leads to substantially enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and substantially improved resistance to moisture-induced degradation. When used as a color-conversion layer on top of blue LEDs, the PS–OH modified PQDs enable more efficient photon down-conversion and improved device-level performance. These results demonstrate that functionalized polymers, employed as in-situ ligands, offer a powerful approach for stabilizing and enhancing brightness of perovskite quantum dots for advanced optoelectronic applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-hng84?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Meso-Substitution Controlled Synthesis of BODIPY–DPM Conjugates: A Pathway to Tailored Photophysical Properties</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0zz7t?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We show that the electronic nature of the meso-aryl substituent in 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl BODIPYs governs the reactivity of the 1,7-methyl (α-methyl) groups toward the Knoevenagel condensation. Reaction of pyrrole-2-aldehyde with electron-deficient 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-meso-pentafluorophenyl and 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-meso-4-nitrophenyl BODIPYs yields double condensation at the 1,7-methyl positions to give the corresponding bis(pyrrole) derivatives, whereas the electron-rich meso-tolyl analogue selectively undergoes single condensation at only one of the α-methyl groups under identical conditions. This substituent-dependent divergence extends to reactions with 1,9-diformyl-meso-aryl dipyrromethanes, enabling access to structurally distinct BODIPY–DPM conjugates. Reaction of 1,9-diformyl-DPM with meso-tolyl BODIPY selectively yields acyclic monosubstituted BODIPY–DPM conjugates, whereas the higher reactivity of meso-pentafluorophenyl BODIPY enables condensation between both 1,7-methyl groups and the two aldehyde functionalities of the diformyl-DPM scaffold, affording cyclic, porphyrin-like BODIPY–DPM frameworks. Notably, meso-pentafluorophenyl BODIPYs also undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the para-fluorine atom by piperidine under the condensation conditions, as confirmed unambiguously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The resulting BODIPY–DPM and BODIPY–pyrrole conjugates exhibit pronounced bathochromic shifts (90–180 nm relative to parent BODIPYs), deep-red to near-infrared absorption (~670 nm) and emission (~750 nm), enlarged Stokes shifts, and strong intramolecular charge-transfer character. These features translate into efficient heavy-atom-free triplet formation, with singlet-oxygen quantum yields reaching up to 0.45. A representative conjugate (10) exhibits potent photodynamic activity in B16F10 melanoma cells with minimal dark toxicity (IC₅₀ = 0.95 μM). TD-DFT analysis indicates that excited-state twisting reduces ΔEST, thereby facilitating heavy-atom-independent intersystem crossing. Collectively, these results establish a robust molecular design framework for next-generation heavy-atom-free photosensitizers.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0zz7t?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Elimination of wing tilt laterally overgrown GaN</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/011903/3376334/Elimination-of-wing-tilt-laterally-overgrown-GaN</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Wing tilt and associated defects at the coalescence boundary in GaN were completely eliminated in a maskless homoepitaxial overgrowth process, whereas SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-masked homoepitaxial overgrowth showed the same effects as samples grown on sapphire or SiC.

This study demonstrates that isonicotinamide (IA)—previously shown to enhance bulk perovskite solar cells via defect passivation—can be strategically applied to quantum dots (QDs) by replacing oleylamine (OLA) ligands. Systematic studies reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the thermalization coefficient (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Qth&lt;/span&gt;) on IA/OLA ratios in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3−x&lt;/sub&gt; QDs. At optimal concentrations, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Qth&lt;/span&gt; decreases to 1.89 ± 0.059 mW⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanied by a prolonged carrier lifetime (17.7 ns), attributed to dual functional groups of IA passivating undercoordinated Pb defects. However, excess IA overcrowds surfaces of QDs, displacing OLA and creating new defects that increase &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Qth&lt;/span&gt;. These competing effects determine an optimal IA/OLA ratio for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Qth&lt;/span&gt; minimization, which is almost two orders of magnitude lower than in bulk materials. The suppressed hot carrier thermalization could significantly enhance the maximum achievable power conversion efficiency of HCSC. This work establishes the perovskite QDs as promising wide bandgap absorbers for HCSC and provides a ligand-engineering strategy to optimize hot carrier dynamics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/011904/3376101/Observation-of-the-slower-thermalization-process</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Defect dipole engineered hybrid polar configurations for high dielectric energy storage under low electric fields</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/013901/3376085/Defect-dipole-engineered-hybrid-polar</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Dielectric capacitors are vital components in advanced electronics and high-power electrical systems.

The coexistence of macro- and micro-domains in the optimal proportion improves interdomain interactions, effectively suppressing hysteresis while still retaining ferroelectric polarization. Meanwhile, the depolarization field generated by defect dipoles drives the aligned domains to revert to their initial disordered state. Together, this dual mechanism weakens remanent polarization (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), enabling the simultaneous reduction of energy loss (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;) and enhancement of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rec&lt;/sub&gt;.

In this study, an irradiation-hardened quasi-vertical GaN PiN diode with a beveled-mesa termination structure is fabricated, exhibiting only an 8% reduction in blocking voltage under 1.3 GeV Ta ion irradiation with a high fluence of ∼10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This robustness enables in-depth analysis of electrical degradation under the synergistic effects of irradiation and bias voltage. Forward &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; analysis reveals reductions in minority carrier lifetime, mobility, and diffusion length. Temperature-dependent reverse &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I–V&lt;/span&gt; characteristics show an upward shift in the transition voltage from variable range hopping leakage to space-charge-limited current conduction in irradiated devices, with additional involvement of trap-assisted Poole–Frenkel emission. deep-level transient spectroscopy identifies a shallow trap E2 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.1 eV) and two deep traps, E1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.43 eV) and H1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;v + 0.68 eV). E1 exhibits a twofold increase in trap density post-irradiation and is attributed to dislocation-related defects or Ga vacancies.

These traps, driven by the high electronic energy loss, could introduce localized recombination centers and scattering sites.

Although [6+4] pericyclic reactions of tropone derivatives and dienes have been investigated since the mid 1960s, little work has been performed to look at the factors that may affect the energy barriers of both the forward and reverse reaction. In this work, we use DFT calculations and experimental analyses to examine the cycloaddition reactions of tropone derivatives with dienes. We find that DFT calculations at the m062x-6-31G(d) level of theory are consistent with experimentally derived values of  ΔG‡ for the reactions of some tropone derivatives with cyclopentadiene. Likewise, calculations provide reasonable predictions of the distribution of [6+4] and competitive [4+2] adducts, with [6+4] adducts converting to the more stable [4+2] adducts at elevated temperatures. Finally, we observe that even the rather stable [4+2] adducts show some reversion to the starting tropone. Due to the alignment between calculations and experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data, this work highlights the value of employing DFT methods in the future to help in the design of new reversible cycloadditions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0bwtk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Modulating Polymorphic Phase Boundaries and Defect Chemistry in KNN-Based Piezoceramics Through Multi-Element Doping Strategies</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wfgdd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Lead-free potassium-sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO₃, KNN) ceramics represent a promising alternative to replace lead-based piezoelectrics in energy harvesting and actuator applications due to their high Curie temperature and favorable ferroelectric properties. This study investigates the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of pure KNN and multi-element doped compositions: (K0.4Na0.48Bi0.1La0.02)(Nb0.9Ti0.1)O3 (KNN-BiLaTi) and (K0.4Na0.56La0.02Y0.02)(Nb0.9V0.05Sb0.05)O3 (KNN-LaYVSb), synthesized via conventional solid-state methods. Structural analysis (XRD/Rietveld) revealed single-phase orthorhombic perovskite structures (space group Amm2) for all samples, with no detectable secondary phases. XPS, Raman, SEM, and TEM revealed that the dopants tune defect chemistry, suppress surface alkali degradation, and refine the microstructure, especially in dense, low-porosity KNN-LaYVSb, which has pronounced lattice distortion for favorable domain wall motion. Dielectric experiments demonstrated lower orthorhombic–tetragonal transition temperatures and wider, more diffuse phase transitions. However, Curie temperatures remained high, indicating reliable operation over a wide range of temperatures. At optimal poling, KNN-LaYVSb attained the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d₃₃ = 221 pC/N) and excellent thermal stability up to 275 °C, retaining over 90% of room-temperature value and over 80% at elevated temperatures near 450 °C. The improved temperature stability arises from diffuse phase transitions, defect-dipole stabilization, and nanoscale heterogeneity due to multi-element doping. The remnant polarization increased from 3.49 µC/cm² (Pure-KNN) to 25.3 µC/cm² (KNN-LaYVSb) with significantly reduced coercive field (6.10 kV/cm). These findings illustrate that selective multi-element co-doping at A- and B-sites effectively modifies polymorphic phase boundaries near room temperature by improving defect chemistry through controlled vacancy formation and optimizing microstructure. This results in robust, high-performance lead-free piezoceramics for advanced energy harvesting and sensing applications operating across wide temperature ranges.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wfgdd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Minding the Band gap: Major Factors for Correlating Computations with Experiments in Cu14 and Au20 Atomically Precise Nanoclusters</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-km72d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In a Perspective article titled "Mind the Gap!", Bredas clarifies the distinction between different uses of the term  "band gap" in the context of experimentally measured or computationally evaluated energy gaps. In view of the tremendous progress in atomically precise metal nanoclusters where electrochemical and optical energetics are routinely supported by computations to establish structure-function correlations, we explore the relationship between different protocols for measuring and computing band gaps of two distinct organic ligand-protected nanoclusters: [Cu14H10(MBN)3(PPh3)8]+ and Au20(TBBT)16. Through UV/visible spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, we measure optical and electrochemical band gaps in those systems. We then compare these experimental gaps to HOMO-LUMO gaps, fundamental gaps, vertical excitation energies, and Eox - Ered potentials computed using density functional theory (DFT) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). We test functionals with varying degrees of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange from 0% to 50%, different correlation functionals, basis sets, and (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) continuum solvation models. We find that in both copper and gold nanoclusters, the most important factor affecting the magnitude of the band gap is the % HF exchange, which in the case of the HOMO-LUMO gap can vary by several eV. This sensitivity is partially mitigated when computing the fundamental, optical, and electrochemical gaps. The second most important factor is the proper description of solvation effects. Other factors, such as the nature of the correlation functional, basis set, and geometry relaxation, have a considerably smaller effect on computed band gaps in these systems. Overall, this work provides generalizable guidelines on factors at varied importance for correlating computed and experimental "band gap" values.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-km72d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Materials: Table of Contents] Revisiting Ferroelectric‐Gated Phototransistors: A Tripartite Synapse‐Inspired Approach to In‐Sensor Image Processing (Adv.

Microcrystals</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3xz24?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>All-inorganic halide perovskites, especially CsPbBr3 microcrystals, are often considered to be 
optically stable and less defect-prone compared to their organometallic counterparts. 
Nevertheless, reports of photoluminescence (PL) blinking in bulk perovskite systems till date 
are restricted to organometallic halide perovskite nano-/microrods, leaving it an open question 
whether similar intermittency behaviour can be observed in all-inorganic halide perovskites of 
comparable dimensions. Intriguingly, we witnessed multi-level PL fluctuations (flickering) in 
individual green-emitting CsPbBr3 microrods. Wide-field PL microscopy reveals that the 
intensity fluctuations are nearly identical along the microrod, owing to charge carrier migration,  
and waveguide‑assisted propagation. Our measurements on single microrod suggests that the 
flickering dynamics is strongly influenced by excitation power, excitation energy, and local 
environmental constituents. Under dry argon environment, a sharp reduction in the PL intensity 
is observed, indicating the formation of large number of nonradiative (NR) centers which 
quenches all the photogenerated carriers, suppressing overall emission intensity and PL 
flickering. The exposure of oxygen passivates these NR traps generated under argon, while 
humidity introduces metastable photoinduced NR traps (“special quenchers”) that govern the 
enhanced flickering behaviours. Our findings establish that spatiotemporally correlated 
intermittency is not limited to organometallic perovskites but extends to all-inorganic 
perovskite bulk emitters as well and provides new insights into the role of transient defects and 
atmospheric constituents in dictating emission stability.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3xz24?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Magnesium-Catalysed, Hydroboration of C–C sigma-bonds of Benzylidene Cyclobutanes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-vqpmn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C–C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-vqpmn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Crystallization modulation for wide-bandgap perovskites with universal defect passivation toward efficient perovskite/organic tandem photovoltaics</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68125-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 03 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68125-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68125-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Defect formation and phase instability remain critical challenges for perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.

Here, we elucidate the electropolymerization-assisted polymerisation of carbazolyl Blatter radicals into thin films with nanometer-precision thickness control, as well as into free-standing thin films with the retained redox characteristics of Blatter radicals integrated within. Utilising the high chemical stability of Blatter radicals, terminal carbazole units were introduced on the 1,2,4-benzotriazinyl unit via Pd(0)-catalysed C-C coupling reaction, yielding new carbazolyl monomers Cz3N• and Cz2N•. Application of an oxidative potential of 1.5 V to monomers and varying the number of scans, enabled formation of polymer thin films, polyCz3N• and polyCz2N•, with a desired nanometer thickness (30-500 nm). Both monomers and polymers showed characteristic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and high redox reversibility associated with the Blatter radical. Density functional theory (DFT) indicated spin delocalisation on the 1,2,4-benzotriazinyl units and supported the experimental trends of optical properties (λ &gt; 500 nm), band gaps of Blatter radical monomers (2.33-2.48 eV) and polymer thin films (2.30-2.39 eV). Driven by strong π-π stacking interactions between 1,2,4-benzotriazinyl units in solid-state interactions, Cz3N• showed strong antiferromagnetic interactions with 2J/kB value of −53.16 K and a singlet–triplet energy gap of −0.1 kcal mol−1.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dxt0r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Among various implementations, FeFET-based physical reservoir computing systems are promising owing to the intrinsic nonlinearity and short-term memory of ferroelectric polarization and compatibility with standard CMOS technology. For analog signal applications, the method of converting input signals into gate voltage waveforms is critical to leverage the nonlinearity in ferroelectric polarization dynamics, since ferroelectric polarization dynamics are highly sensitive to applied voltage ranges. In this study, we experimentally examine how different voltage conversion methods influence the performance of FeFET-based RC systems. We first examine a conventional linear analog method, which linearly maps analog inputs to amplitudes of triangular voltage pulses. While simple, this method suffers from significant information loss due to insufficient polarization switching in the low-voltage region, leading to poor computational performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose split analog method, which introduces a voltage gap to exclude non-switching regions, ensuring that input pulses effectively activate ferroelectric dynamics across a wide input range. This method enables access to diverse polarization states by exploiting partial switching behavior. Our experiments demonstrate that split analog method significantly improves performance in input recall, delay, and time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, combining this method with a gate delay architecture enables high-accuracy prediction even in complex temporal tasks. These results highlight that the careful voltage waveform design transformed to the polarization dynamics is essential for fully leveraging the computational potential of FeFET-based RC systems in neuromorphic applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/1/011101/3375948/Efficient-harnessing-of-polarization-dynamics-in</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics] Atomic scale octahedral distortion and enhanced collective polarity underlying large polarization in ferroelectric perovskite oxides</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001492?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 31 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Materiomics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Xiali Liang, Jian Wang, Wanbiao Hu&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:36:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001492</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Many-electron characterizations of higher-charge superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23801</link><description>arXiv:2512.23801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of conventional superconductivity as the phonon-assisted formation and condensation of two-electron Cooper pairs is a significant triumph in condensed matter physics. Here, we propose many-electron characterizations of higher-charge superconductivity with Cooper pairs consisting of more than two electrons, by implementing translation symmetrization on parent pair-density-wave-ordered states. In particular, we demonstrate many-electron constructions with vanishing charge-2e sectors, but with sharp signatures in charge-4e or charge-6e expectation values instead. Such characterizations are consistent with previous phenomenology of vestigial order and Ginzburg-Landau theory, yet, instead of point-group-symmetry presumptions, we show that momentum conservation is both vital and sufficient. Our study thus offers a novel, general, and microscopic route to understand and characterize higher-charge superconductivity, including nontrivial experimental signatures such as fractional magnetic flux and period in interferometry, as well as localized Cooper pairs at lattice topological defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Competing Antiferromagnetic Phases in Multiferroic Wurtzite Transition-Metal Chalcogenides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23904</link><description>arXiv:2512.23904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics offers a pathway toward electrically controllable spin-based devices beyond ferromagnets. Here, we identify wurtzite MnX (X = S, Se, Te) as a family of multiferroic materials hosting competing AFM phases, including altermagnetic, where nonrelativistic spin splitting can be controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Using density-functional theory and atomistic spin-model calculations, we show that all pristine MnX compounds stabilize a stripe type collinear AFM ground state, contrary to earlier predictions of an altermagnetic ground state, with the magnetic order governed by frustrated Heisenberg and biquadratic exchange interactions. We further demonstrate that Cr doping drives a transition to an A-type AFM phase that breaks Kramers spin degeneracy and realizes a g-wave altermagnetic state with large nonrelativistic spin splitting near the Fermi level. Importantly, this spin splitting can be deterministically reversed by polarization switching, enabling electric-field control of altermagnetic electronic structure without reorienting the Neel vector or relying on spin-orbit coupling. The close energetic proximity of the stripe AFM to a noncollinear all-in-all-out configuration indicates that wurtzite MnX lies near a topological magnetic phase with finite scalar spin chirality, which may be stabilized by modest perturbations such as temperature, strain or chemical tuning. The distinct magnetic phases exhibit symmetry selective linear and non-linear Hall responses, providing direct transport signatures of altermagnetism and polarization control. Together, these results establish doped wurtzite MnX as a promising platform for altermagnet-ferroelectric multiferroics and electrically AFM spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Visualizing the dispersions of Fermi polaron and molecule via spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23918</link><description>arXiv:2512.23918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to measure the dispersions of Fermi polaron and molecule by engineering spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the impurity, which induces spin flip with finite momentum transfer. The polaron dispersion can be probed at small SOC momentum from the linear response of impurity spin. For molecule, we show that it can be prepared through an adiabatic steady-state evolution when setting SOC momentum as the Fermi momentum of majority bath. By gradually reducing SOC strength to zero, the steady state smoothly evolves to a molecular state with directional symmetry breaking. The corresponding dispersion can then be probed experimentally through the center-of-mass momentum distribution of molecules at finite density. Our scheme reveals a fundamental momentum difference between Fermi polaron and molecule, thereby offering a clear physical picture for their first-order transition in single-impurity system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23918v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlated 5f electronic states and phase stability in americium under high pressure: Insights from DFT+DMFT calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23963</link><description>arXiv:2512.23963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of americium (Am) across its four experimentally confirmed high-pressure phases Am-I (P63/mmc), Am-II (Fm-3m), Am-III (Fddd), and Am-IV (Pnma) up to 100 GPa, using density functional theory combined with embedded dynamical mean-field theory. Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit. Additionally, we demonstrate that the stability of the low-symmetry high-pressure phases (Am-III and Am-IV) is governed by a Peierls-like distortion mechanism, which reduces the total energy through symmetry-lowering lattice distortions accompanied by electronic reconstruction. This study offers a new microscopic perspective on high-pressure phase transitions and emergent quantum phenomena in actinide materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theoretical Insights into Excitons, Optical Properties, and Nonradiative Recombination Dynamics in M$_6$CSe$_4$ (M = Ca, Sr) Antiperovskite Carbides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24093</link><description>arXiv:2512.24093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically predicted antiperovskite carbides M$_6$CSe$_4$ (M = Ca, Sr) represent an emerging class of optoelectronic materials with potential relevance for photovoltaic applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties, together with non-radiative recombination dynamics. Density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (GW) reveal that both compounds are direct band gap semiconductors with gaps spanning the infrared-visible region. Incorporating electron-hole interactions via the Bethe-Salpeter equation leads to pronounced red-shifts in the first peak of optical spectra, indicative of bound excitons with binding energies of 0.12 eV (Ca$_6$CSe$_4$) and 0.20 eV (Sr$_6$CSe$_4$), extending over nearly three unit cells in all directions. Time-dependent DFT combined with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K reveals pronounced lattice fluctuations in Ca$_6$CSe$_4$, resulting in 38% larger band gap variations and 28% faster electronic decoherence. Together with 53% weaker nonadiabatic couplings, these effects yield non-radiative recombination lifetimes approximately eleven times longer than in Sr$_6$CSe$_4$. Overall, our results identify M$_6$CSe$_4$ carbides as promising lead-free photovoltaic materials, with Ca$_6$CSe$_4$ exhibiting superior optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics that motivate further experimental investigation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-scale visualization of d-wave altermagnetism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24114</link><description>arXiv:2512.24114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture. Our work provides the foundational real-space evidence for altermagnetism, moving the field from theoretical and momentum-space probes to direct visual confirmation; thereby opening a path to explore how this unconventional magnetic order couples to and controls other quantum electronic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Increased Covalence and V-center mediated Dark Fenton-Like Reactions in V-doped TiO2: Mechanisms of Enhanced Charge-Transfer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24219</link><description>arXiv:2512.24219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the valence state and electronic structure of catalytically active sites is crucial for improving Fenton and Fenton-like reactions, which rely on the efficient activation of the H2O2 molecule. Pure TiO2, however, has inadequate activity towards the H2O2 activation and is often constrained by the intrinsic electronic limitations of pristine TiO2. Herein, a rational approach has been demonstrated to improve the Fenton-like catalytic performance of TiO2 through multivalent vanadium (V) doping. A comprehensive characterization using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that V incorporation substantially alters the electronic structure of TiO2. The DFT results, supported by experimental data, indicate that V doping enhances Ti-O covalence and introduces mid-gap states, resulting in a reduced band gap and improved charge transfer. XPS confirms the coexistence of multiple oxidation states of V, which serve as active centres for activating H2O2 and generating OH radicals. As a result, V-doped TiO2 exhibits significantly enhanced dark-catalytic activity in degrading the organic dye Rhodamine B (RhB). Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into multivalent-cation-induced valence state and electronic structure modulation in TiO2, offering a promising strategy for designing high-performance catalysts via defect engineering for sustainable environmental remediation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Using Particle Shape to Control Defects in Colloidal Crystals on Spherical Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24399</link><description>arXiv:2512.24399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical particles confined to a sphere surface cannot pack densely into a hexagonal lattice without defects. In this study, we use hard particle Monte Carlo simulations to determine the effects of continuously deformable shape anisotropy and underlying crystal lattice preference on inevitable defect structures and their distribution within colloidal assemblies of hard rounded polyhedra confined to a closed sphere surface. We demonstrate that cube particles form a simple square assembly, overcoming lattice/topology incompatibility, and maximize entropy by distributing eight three-fold defects evenly on the sphere. By varying particle shape smoothly from cubes to spheres we reveal how the distribution of defects changes from square antiprismatic to icosahedral symmetry. Congruent studies of rounded tetrahedra reveal additional varieties of characteristic defect patterns within three, four, and six-fold symmetric lattices. This work has promising implications for programmable defect generation to facilitate different vesicle buckling modes using colloidal particle emulsions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Wafer-Scale Integration of Piezo- and Ferroelectric Al0.64Sc0.36N Thin Films by Reactive Sputtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24455</link><description>arXiv:2512.24455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-area deposition of Aluminium-Scandium-Nitride (Al1-xScxN) thin films with higher Sc content (x) remains challenging due to issues such as abnormal orientation growth, stress control, and the undesired crystal phase. These anomalies across the wafer hinder the development of high scandium-content AlScN films, which are critical for microelectromechanical systems applications. In this study, we report the sputter deposition of Al0.64Sc0.36N thin films from a 300 mm Al0.64Sc0.36 alloy target on 200 mm Si(100) wafers, achieving an exceptionally high deposition rate of 8.7 {\mu}m/h with less than 1% AOGs and controllable stress tuning. Comprehensive microstructural and electrical characterizations confirm the superior growth of high-quality Al0.64Sc0.36N films with exceptional wafer-average piezoelectric coefficients (d33,f =15.62 pm/V and e31,f = -2.9 C/m2) owing to low point defects density and grain mosaicity. This was accomplished through the implementation of an optimized seed layer and a refined electrode integration strategy, along with optimal process conditions. The wafer yield and device failure rates are analysed and correlated with the average stress of the films and their stress profiles along the diameter. The resulting films show excellent uniformity in structural, compositional, and piezoelectric properties across the entire 200 mm wafer, underscoring their strong potential for next-generation MEMS applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24455v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Origins of spontaneous magnetic fields in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24585</link><description>arXiv:2512.24585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the broken time reversal symmetry (BTRS) state in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ remains elusive, and its relation to superconductivity remains controversial. There are various universal predictions for the BTRS state when it is associated with a multicomponent superconducting order parameter. In particular, in the BTRS superconducting state, spontaneous fields appear around crystalline defects, impurities, superconducting domain walls and sample surfaces. However, this phenomenon has not yet been experimentally demonstrated for any BTRS superconductor. Here, we aimed to verify these predictions for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by performing muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$ single crystals at ambient pressure and stoichiometric Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under hydrostatic pressure. The study allowed us to conclude that spontaneous fields in the BTRS superconducting state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ appear around non-magnetic inhomogeneities and, at the same time, decrease with the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$. The observed behaviour is consistent with the prediction for multicomponent BTRS superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. The results of the work are relevant to understanding BTRS superconductivity in general, as they demonstrate, for the first time, the relationship among the superconducting order parameter, the BTRS transition, and crystal-structure inhomogeneities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24585v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disentangle Intertwined Interactions in Correlated Charge Density Wave with Magnetic Impurities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24668</link><description>arXiv:2512.24668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in strongly correlated electronic systems serve as sensitive probes to a wide range of many-body quantum phenomena. Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind such site-specific interactions have been poorly understood. Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mobility-induced phase separation in a binary mixture of active Brownian particles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24761</link><description>arXiv:2512.24761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report a Brownian dynamics simulation of the mobility-induced phase separation which occurs in a two-dimensional binary mixture of active soft Brownian particles, whose interactions are modeled by non-additive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potentials inspired in Lennard-Jones potentials used for glass-forming passive mixtures. The analysis of structural properties, such as the radial distribution functions and the hexatic order parameter, shows that the high-density coexisting state in the binary case is spatially disordered, unlike the solid-like state observed for the monocomponent system. Characterization of the mean-square displacement of the active particles shows that both the low- and high-density coexisting states have diffusive behavior for long times. Thus, the high-density coexisting states are liquid-like in the binary cases. Moreover, diffusive behavior is also observed in the high-density solid-like state for the monocomponent system, which is driven by the presence of active topological defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Melting curve of correlated iron at Earth's core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25061</link><description>arXiv:2512.25061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable constraints on iron's melting curve at Earth's inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link><description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime.

However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Configurational-entropy-driven structural and optical stability in high-entropy halide perovskites for broadband NIR photonics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24328</link><description>arXiv:2512.24328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By injecting configurational entropy into soft ionic lattices, high-entropy halide perovskites offer a compelling route toward photonic materials that are both functionally rich and operationally robust; however, converting compositional complexity into predictable optical function remains challenging. Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TLS-induced thermal nonlinearity in a micro-mechanical resonator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24539</link><description>arXiv:2512.24539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of a thermally-driven amplitude-frequency nonlinearity in a thin-film quartz phononic crystal resonator at millikelvin temperatures. The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Imaging nanoscale photocarrier traps in solar water-splitting catalysts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24543</link><description>arXiv:2512.24543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects trap photocarriers and hinder solar water splitting. The nanoscale photocarrier transport, trapping, and recombination mechanisms are usually inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements and remain elusive. Because an individual high-performing nanoparticle photocatalyst may outperform the ensemble average, design rules that would otherwise enhance catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Investigation of resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au using Reactive Molecular Dynamics and ab-initio quantum transport calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11437</link><description>arXiv:2407.11437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the underlying physical mechanism for electric-field induced resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au based memristive devices by combining reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) and ab-initio quantum transport calculations. Using MD with Au/Mo/S ReaxFF potential, we observe the formation of realistic conductive filament consisting of gold atoms through monolayer MoS2 layer when sufficient electric field is applied. We furthermore instigate the rupture of the gold atom filament when a sufficiently large electric field is applied in the opposite direction. To calculate the conductance of the obtained structures and identify the High Resistance (HR) and Low Resistance (LR) states, we employ the ab-initio electron transport calculations by importing the atomic structures from MD calculations. For single-defect MoS2 memristors, the obtained LRS, HRS current densities are in order of 10^7 A/cm^2 which agrees reasonably well with the reported experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.11437v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of Quasi-Quantum Hall Effect and Coulomb Disorder in Semimetals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05273</link><description>arXiv:2412.05273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low carrier densities in topological semimetals (TSMs) enable the exploration of novel magnetotransport in the quantum limit (QL). Recent findings consistent with 3D quasi-quantum Hall effect (QQHE) have positioned TSMs as promising platforms for exploring 3D quantum Hall transport, but the lack of tunability in the Fermi level has thus far limited the ability to observe a QQHE signal. Here, we tune the defect concentrations in the Dirac semimetal Cd${}_3$As${}_2$ to achieve ultra-low carrier concentrations at 2 K around $2.9\times10^{16}$cm${}^{-3}$, giving way to QQHE signal at modest fields near 10 T. At low carrier densities, where QQHE is most accessible, we find that clear QQHE is obscured by a carrier density dependent background originating from Coulomb disorder from charged point defects and Landau level broadening. Our results highlight the interplay between QQHE and Coulomb disorder, demonstrating that clear observation of QQHE in TSMs intricately depends on Fermi level and disorder magnitudes. We find that Coulomb disorder, as theoretically predicted, is an essential ingredient for understanding the magnetoresistivity for a spectrum of Fermi levels in Cd${}_3$As${}_2$, anchoring the role of defects and charged disorder in TSM applications. We discuss future constraints and opportunities in exploring 3D QQHE and quantum Hall effects in TSMs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.05273v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced negative capacitance in La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ ferroelectric capacitor from tuning of bias voltage pulse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23448</link><description>arXiv:2507.23448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a remarkable bias voltage dependent specific negative capacitance in multidomain La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ (PLZT) ferroelectric capacitors. The specific negative capacitance maximizes at a specific bias voltage because of emergence of maximum domain-wall density during ``switching" of the domains. Domain configuration changes from such an ``optimum" state if higher or lower bias voltage is applied at a much faster or slower rate. Phase-field simulation using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation corroborates the experimental results and shows dependence of the domain-wall length during switching on the bias voltage amplitude and its maximization at a specific bias voltage amplitude. Interestingly, the radius of curvature of the resulting polarization ($P$) versus voltage ($V$) hysteresis loop at the coercive voltage ($V_C$), as well, turns out to be depending on the bias voltage. All these results indicate a close correlation among the bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and time scale), domain-wall length during switching, shape of the resulting ferroelectric hysteresis loop, and the transient negative capacitance. It may have important ramifications both in the context of physics behind negative capacitance in a multidomain ferroelectric capacitor and devices being developed by exploiting its advantages.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23448v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transient Absorption Spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19188</link><description>arXiv:2510.19188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NbOI$_2$ has recently emerged as a new van der Waals material combining semiconducting behavior with intrinsic in plane ferroelectricity and pronounced transport and optical anisotropy. However, its photocarrier dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here we report transient absorption spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$ using femtosecond pump probe reflectance measurements. A pronounced transient absorption feature is observed near the 2.34 eV excitonic resonance, arising from photocarrier induced excitonic energy shifts and saturation. The decay dynamics reveal an exciton lifetime of several tens of picoseconds and show density-dependent behavior consistent with exciton exciton annihilation and defect-assisted Auger recombination, yielding a rate of 0.4 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Polarization resolved measurements further reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy in the transient response that follows the linear absorption anisotropy. These findings provide fundamental insight into photocarrier dynamics in NbOI$_2$ and establish key parameters for understanding and exploiting its optoelectronic behavior.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.19188v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Partially polaron-transformed quantum master equation for exciton and charge transport dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02812</link><description>arXiv:2203.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaron-transformed quantum master equation (PQME) offers a unified framework to describe the dynamics of quantum systems in both limits of weak and strong couplings to environmental degrees of freedom. Thus, PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. A formal framework to address this issue is developed in the present work by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a 2nd order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model of two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with test calculations focused on those due to homogeneous relaxation terms, demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of the present approach.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2203.02812v3</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: eScience] Modulation of electron delocalization and localization induced by single-atom alloys on defective H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3−y&lt;/sub&gt; for boosting photocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide to ammonia</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725001594?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 30 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; eScience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Haibo Yin, Haiwei Su, Hua Zhao, Chao He, Tianchang Lei, Xiaoguang Zhao, Yakun Qu, Weizhen Ye, Yu Wu, Xing Yuan, Yunlong Wang, Yuan Li, Junting Wang, Gaoke Zhang, Junhua Li&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: eScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:25:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725001594</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today Physics] Defect Engineering Enables Ultra-Stable Radiation-resistant Optical Transparency in Polycrystalline Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; Ceramics</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529325003657?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 31 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Materials Today Physics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Lexing Liang, Cong Zhang, Mao Deng, Junjing Duan, Xiaolan Zhou, Zaixin Wei, Kailei Lu, Yanli Shi, Zhangyi Huang, Jianqi Qi, Tiecheng Lu&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today Physics</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:25:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529325003657</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics] One-step sintering enabled structural stability and defect suppression even in Fe-off-stoichiometric BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; piezoceramics</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001480?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 30 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Materiomics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Shiyuan Zhang, Xingyuan Qi, Jinhao Hu, Xianxin Zhang, Mengping Xue, Bo-Ping Zhang&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:36:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001480</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Boosting electrical breakdown strength in sodium bismuth titanate based relaxor ferroelectric ceramics by constructing composite structure for energy storage</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25049175?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 146&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Yunxuan Xu, Xuhai Shi, Zong-Yang Shen, Dong-Xu Li, Jiamou Wu, Wenqin Luo&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:36:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25049175</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

For reaction barriers and water clusters, some of us earlier found that HF-DFT succeeds not because the HF density is accurate, but due to cancellation of negative functional-driven error (FE) by positive density-driven error (DE). Since DE, as defined here, is biased toward the self-consistent DFA density and against the HF density, the DE of the HF density is referred to as non-variational density over-localization (NVDO). In this work, we show that interaction energy errors in halogen- and chalcogen-bonded complexes in the B30 data set are not dominated by density-driven error. Instead, HF-DFT again succeeds through FE–DE cancellation. Benchmark Kohn–Sham inversions of coupled-cluster densities for NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF, Cl-…SF2, Cl-...SCF2, and Cl-…PF3 provide strong evidence for this cancellation. For additional complexes, we employ the long-range-corrected hybrid LCωPBE as a proxy for electron-transfer errors in the exact density. We also examine several self-interaction correction (SIC) methods and find significant improvement from FLOSIC. We point out common features of the density errors in the NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF complexes and three transition states, arguing that significant density-driven errors of energy arise only from electron-transfer errors. We also highlight a common feature in our present and previous work: long bonds can lead to non-negligible functional-driven self-interaction error of the energy from otherwise-accurate semi-local functionals in transition states, water clusters, and halogen or chalcogen bonds.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-wfft9-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Thiol-bearing tertiary alkylammonium chloride for regulation of PbI2 excess in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>One of the key strategies for record photovoltaic efficiencies in metal halide perovskite solar cells is the addition of PbI2 excess in a stoichiometric perovskite solution which controls crystallization, passivates defects and induces a preferred orientation in the perovskite layer. However, residual PbI2, typically found in the perovskite layer after crystallization, generates non-radiative recombination centres and promotes ion migration under light and heating stress, thus accelerating performance loss. To mitigate the above issues, a common strategy is the post-deposition of organic ammonium salts which interact in situ with residual PbI2. Here, we adopt a multifunctional alkylammonium salt, 2-diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride (DEAET), in which both the thiol (–SH) and protonated tertiary amine groups can strongly bind to PbI₂. Upon deposition of DEAET on top of FAPbI3 film, we show that DEAT decreases the percentage of residual PbI2 by 40% and totally eliminates Pb0. These two effects lead to enhanced radiative recombination, proving a net passivation effect, while chemical analysis (FTIR and liquid-state NMR) explains that this is due to strong interactions between tertiary protonated ammonium (-NH+) and thiol (-SH) groups of DEAT with under-coordinated Pb2+. The stabilization of FAPbI3 black phase along with the establishment of a solid barrier to impede the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite layer over time lead to enhanced operational stability for the as-fabricated solar cells. The encouraging findings of this study lay the foundation for the utilization of tertiary ammonium thiol-based salts as efficient agents for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Hot-Carrier Injection and Millisecond Charge Separation From a Robust Heteroleptic Iron(II) Chromophore Immobilized on TiO2</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tg48m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, computational analysis, and photoelectrochemical behavior of a new iron-based chromophore, [(Cpy)2Fe(deeb)](PF6)2 (Fe(Cpy)2(deeb)), where Cpy is 1- methyl-3-(2-pyridyl)imidazole and deeb is 4,4’-(CO2CH2CH3)2-2,2’-bipyridine, is reported. Electrochemically reversible waves assigned to a metal-centered Eo(FeIII/II) = +0.48 and a ligand- centered E(0)(Fe2+/+) = -1.47 V vs Fc+/0 reduction were evident in cyclic voltammetry measurements. The combination of a strong -donor and a -acceptor lowered the energy of the metal-to-ligand charge- transfer (MLCT) excited state relative to the metal-centered state. Two MLCT transitions appear in the visible region at 424 nm and 580 nm. DFT calculations revealed that the lower-energy band was well formulated as Fe(II)→deeb and the higher-energy transition was charge transfer to both the deeb and Cpy ligands. Resonance Raman spectroscopy supports these findings showing enhanced deeb vibrational modes with 532 nm excitation, both deeb and Cpy modes with 473 nm excitation, and exclusively Cpy with 405 nm excitation. Ultrafast spectroscopy reveals a short-lived (~2 ps) MLCT excited state and a longer-lived (~20 ps) metal-centered state. Efficient methods to deprotect the ester groups and anchor the complex to mesoporous TiO2 (anatase) thin films in high surface coverages, Fe(Cpy)2(dcb)|TiO2  = 3 x 10-8 mol/cm2, were established. Pulsed light excitation of Fe(Cpy)2(dcb)|TiO2 resulted in rapid excited state injection (kinj &gt; 108 s-1) and formation of a charge- separated state, FeIII(Cpy)2(dcb)|TiO2(e-), which persists on the millisecond time scale before returning cleanly to the ground state with second-order kinetics. Injection yields measured 50 ns after light excitation were found to double from  [PHI] = 0.15 with green (532 nm) light to [PHI] = 0.30 with blue (457 nm) light excitation. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (% IPCE) measurements as a function of excitation wavelength in a 0.5 M LiI/I2/CH3CN electrolyte provide clear evidence for band-selective 1 ‘hot carrier’ injection from the remote Cpy-localized excited state. Collectively, the spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical data indicate that a semiconductor can intercept hot electrons even when the excited-state dipole is oriented away from the surface-anchoring ligand.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tg48m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Shortcomings of Linear-Response TD-DFT for ESA Oscillator Strength Calculations</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770/asset/images/medium/ct5c01770_0004.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:06:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Electronic and Geometric Symmetry in Chalcogen-Bonded Telluronium Cations Revealed by 125Te NMR and DFT</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552/asset/images/medium/jp5c05552_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry C&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:28:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Defect-Assisted Recombination in Semiconductors and Photovoltaic Device Parameters from First Principles</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12981</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c12981/asset/images/medium/ja5c12981_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c12981&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:03:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12981</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22321v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A scanning probe microscopy approach for identifying defects in aluminum oxide</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22369</link><description>arXiv:2512.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hf/Zr Superlattice-Based High-\k{appa} Gate Dielectrics with Dipole Layer Engineering for Advanced CMOS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22505</link><description>arXiv:2512.22505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced logic transistors require gate dielectrics that achieve sub-nanometer equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), suppress leakage, and satisfy three key requirements: (i) compatibility with RMG-like high-temperature processing, (ii) sufficient Vth tunability for multi-Vth design, and (iii) high device reliability. However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Myofibroblasts slow down defect recombination dynamics in mixed cell monolayers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22923</link><description>arXiv:2512.22923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular organization and mechanotransduction pathways are crucial regulators of tissue morphogenesis, whereas their dysregulation contributes to pathologies. Overactive fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, are key drivers of fibrosis, yet how their presence alters collective cellular ordering remains unclear. Inspired by the analogy between liquid crystals and cells, we investigate how topological defects influence reorganization in dense monolayers of co-cultured fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Owing to steric interactions, these elongated cells exhibit local order; topological defects, where alignment is disrupted, have been postulated to serve as mechanical centers. In this study, we examine how the incorporation of contractile myofibroblasts impacts defect relaxation. The behavior is reminiscent of active nematics with quenched disorder: myofibroblast concentration modulates the disorder strength; increasing their fraction slows defect recombination. Higher myofibroblast concentrations similarly reduce the overall cell alignment on microgrooved surfaces, as myofibroblasts interfere with monolayer reorganization. This observation highlights the potential of a simple, quantitative assay for diagnosing disease progression. Furthermore, we found that myofibroblasts preferentially localize at negatively charged -1/2 defects, compared to fibroblasts, which tend to be localized in +1/2 defects. Consequently, the slowdown of recombination dynamics can be partially attributed to the reduced velocity of the more mobile +1/2 defects. Our study suggests that myofibroblasts can exploit negatively charged defects by avoiding regions of compressive stress and evading apoptosis. Combining live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence studies, this work provides insights into the role of topological defects in fibrotic disease progression.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fast and accurate Fe-H machine-learning interatomic potential for elucidating hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22934</link><description>arXiv:2512.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22934v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Simple and Efficient Non-DFT-Based Machine Learning Interatomic Potential to Simulate Titanium MXenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23063</link><description>arXiv:2512.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Compositional and Oxygen-Vacancy Effects on Phase Stability and Electronic Properties in Ceria-Based Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23120</link><description>arXiv:2512.23120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerium-based lanthanide high-entropy oxides (LN-HEOs) are promising candidates for solid-state electrolyte (mass transport) applications due to their ability to accommodate high concentrations of oxygen vacancies while retaining a fluorite-derived structure. However, synthesis often yields undesired ordered oxygen-deficient phases, such as bixbyite, depending on composition and processing conditions. We utilize first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate phase stability in the model system Ce$_x$(YLaPrSm)$_{1-x}$O$_{2-\delta}$, with the aim of elucidating the thermodynamic factors governing fluorite-bixbyite competition and identifying structure-property relationships to oxygen transport. By independently varying cerium concentration and oxygen vacancy content, we predict that the transition from disordered fluorite to ordered bixbyite is driven primarily by compositional and vacancy-ordering effects, rather than through changes in cation valence. Free-energy analysis reveals that at high vacancy concentrations, bixbyite is enthalpically favored due to ordered oxygen vacancies, while fluorite is stabilized at lower vacancy concentrations and higher cerium content through configurational entropy of the anion sublattice. These DFT results clarify the competing energetic contributions that control phase stability and structure-valence relationships in LN-HEOs and establishes a mechanistic framework for designing vacancy-tolerant oxide electrolytes with tunable phase behavior.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23120v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of robust one-dimensional edge channels in a three-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23277</link><description>arXiv:2512.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link><description>arXiv:2512.23364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23364v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Operando study of the evolution of peritectic structures in metal solidification by quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23501</link><description>arXiv:2512.23501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 {\deg}C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exploring phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals using liquid-phase TEM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23588</link><description>arXiv:2512.23588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) and their nanocomposites are driving the next generation of photonic applications. Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23706</link><description>arXiv:2512.23706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23706v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On Gauging Finite Symmetries by Higher Gauging Condensation Defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22440</link><description>arXiv:2512.22440v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: The nanoscale charge environment critically influences semiconductor physics and device performance. While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent democratizes access to state-of-the-art computational methodologies, accelerating hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton pairs coupled via the long-living phonons and their superfluorescent markers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link><description>arXiv:2501.16874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.16874v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link><description>arXiv:2509.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14762v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link><description>arXiv:2512.21049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like oscillatory statistics can also arise from a purely local dynamical mechanism, revealed using a minimal Lorenz model description of a walking droplet viewed as an active particle with internal degrees of freedom. A localized defect directly perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This work opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs by revealing how quantum-like statistics can emerge from local internal-state dynamics of active particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21049v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PhononBench:A Large-Scale Phonon-Based Benchmark for Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21227</link><description>arXiv:2512.21227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21227v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Synergistic Roles of a Bismuthinide Ligand and Chloride in Accelerating Palladium-Catalyzed Aldol Reactions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-p92g2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We report that the molecular bismuth–palladium pincer complex (BiPdCl) catalyzes the aldol-type coupling of aldehydes with methyl isocyanoacetate with unusually rapid turnover at room temperature. Kinetic and stoichiometric studies reveal saturation behavior toward both substrates, a reversible aldehyde-dimerization side process, and a palladium–isocyanoacetate adduct as the resting state under catalytic conditions. Counterion and metal comparisons show that chloride is uniquely enabling and that the nickel analog is markedly less active. DFT calculations, supported by microkinetic modeling, rule out isonitrile-induced chloride migration from palladium to bismuth, and instead identify a cooperative pathway in which chloride-assisted enolate formation, concerted C–C and C–O bond formation, and subsequent release of an N,O-carbene collectively determine reactivity, with carbene tautomerization to the oxazoline product constituting the overall rate-limiting event. This mechanistic proposal highlights how the strongly donating bismuthinide ligand compresses the catalytic energy landscape and prevents thermodynamic trapping, thereby enabling efficient turnover unmatched by related palladium systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-p92g2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Direct C–H Bond Functionalization of TAPPs: A Versatile Platform for N-Doped Nanographene Construction</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jp978?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nitrogen-doped nanographenes incorporating 1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole (DHPP) cores are promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their tunable electronic structures, robust photostability, and strong fluorescence.

This strategy enables the efficient construction of structurally complex nanographenes, including helically twisted and highly fused π-systems with up to 20 aromatic rings. Se-lect derivatives exhibit strong solvatochromism, red-shifted near-infrared emission (up to 841 nm), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

In particular, crystalline main polymorphs, anatase and rutile, are investigated, as well as amorphous titania for which there is a quantitative lack of data in the liter- ature. Considering thus such defects at the same concentration, we test the effect of three different theoretical approaches, focusing on the effect they play in structural and electronic features of pristine and defective systems. Moving from standard Density Functional Theory, we expand the analysis to the well-assessed DFT+U method of Lichtsteiner, and finally to the recently introduced DFT- 1/2 of Teles et al. which has the merit of perfectly reproducing the experimental bandgap of TiO2 (and of many other semiconductors) making the analysis of defects, which largely relies in a proper descrip- tion of electronic features, extremely improved compared to those obtained at the DFT level which by construction (DFT is a ground-state theory) largely underestimates the electronic bandgap.

However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges that hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct and Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler–Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the simulated TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high current density and a remarkable on–off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262902/3375899/Theoretical-investigation-of-performance-improved</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] All-optically controlled multifunctional logic gates based on the positive and negative photoresponse of a one-dimensional ZnO/CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3  heterostructure</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/263303/3375898/All-optically-controlled-multifunctional-logic</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Optoelectronic logic gates, with high-speed, low-power consumption, and broad bandwidth, have attracted significant attention in high-density information processing applications.

Our hybrid density functional theory study uncovers the mechanism behind this transition. Under O- and Se-poor growth conditions, donor defects  VO+ and  VSe+ form at the highest concentrations, pushing the Fermi level above the conduction band minimum (CBM) and inducing metallic behavior in Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se. As the chemical potentials of O and Se increase to moderate levels, the concentrations of  VO+ and  VSe+ drop, shifting the Fermi level down to the CBM and triggering the MIT. Further enrichment in O and Se yields only a weakly insulating phase, because the densities of  VO2+ and  VSe2+ rise unexpectedly under these rich conditions, preventing the emergence of a highly insulating phase. This counterintuitive trend is explained by defect-correlation mechanism.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262104/3375884/Microscopic-origin-of-metal-insulator-transition</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Evolution of polarization switching kinetics in an Al 0.8 Sc 0.2 N ferroelectric film with electric field cycling</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262903/3375867/Evolution-of-polarization-switching-kinetics-in-an</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Wurtzite-structured ferroelectrics have emerged as prominent materials for next-generation microelectronics due to the advantages of large remnant polarization (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pr&lt;/span&gt;) and tunable coercive electric field (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Ec&lt;/span&gt;).

This work aims to systematically investigate the evolution of polarization switching mechanisms in AlScN thin films during bipolar electrical cycling, and to reveal the potential microstructural origins of the observed fatigue behavior. The switching dynamics were characterized using transient current integration measurements at various electric fields after different cycle numbers.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic polarons are self trapped states of an electron in a locally spin polarised environment. They occur close to the magnetic $T_c$ in low carrier density local moment magnets when the electron-spin coupling is comparable to the hopping scale. In non disordered systems the primary signatures are a modest non-monotonicity in the temperature dependent resistivity $\rho(T)$, and a magnetoresistance that can be $\sim 20-30 \%$ at $T_c$, at fields that, in energy units, are $\sim 0.01 k_BT_c$. We find that structural disorder, in the form of pinning centers, promotes polaron formation, hugely increases the resistivity peak at $T_c$, and can enhance the magnetoresistance to $\sim 80\%$. The change in magnetoresistance with disorder is, however, non-monotonic. Too much disorder just creates an Anderson insulator - with the resistivity unresponsive to the magnetisation. This paper establishes the optimum disorder for maximising the magnetoresistance, suggests the physical process behind the unusual disorder dependence, and provides a magnetoresistance map - in terms of coupling and disorder - that locates some of the existing magnetic semiconductors within this framework.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonvolatile Electrical Control of Spin via Sliding Fractional Quantum Multiferroics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21559</link><description>arXiv:2512.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fractionally quantized polarization induced by interlayer sliding in bilayer altermagnets, unveiling a previously unrecognized multiferroic phase termed sliding fractional quantum multiferroicity (SFQM). This unconventional magnetic phase uniquely integrates sliding ferroelectricity with fractional quantum ferroelectricity, enabling highly efficient switching and nonvolatile electrical control of spin.~Unlike conventional multiferroics, SFQM simultaneously exhibits lattice-scale atomic displacements, ultralow switching barriers, and spin splitting, giving rise to a large fractionally quantized polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify bilayer altermagnet Ca(CoN)$_2$ and its family materials as promising candidates hosting SFQM. In contrast to gate-controlled schemes, the spin-layer coupling in SFQM is intrinsically induced by spontaneous electrical and layer polarization, requiring no sustained gate field and exhibiting nonvolatile character. This mechanism enables nonvolatile electrical control of spin through biaxial sliding, where displacements along the \textit{x}- and \textit{y}-axes generate opposite polarization directions in the layer-dependent electrical polarization. Furthermore, SFQM exhibits a fully switchable anomalous Hall effect and a pronounced magneto-optical response, which can be utilized for its detection and distinction. These findings highlight the promising role of sliding-mediated couplings among unconventional magnetism, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, and stacking order in realizing electrically controllable two-dimensional multiferroics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Origin of Organic Magnetoresistance Using Time-Domain Magnetic Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21629</link><description>arXiv:2512.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic Magnetoresistance is defined as the change of resistance in an organic material, such as a conducting polymer, as a function of an imposed magnetic field. We demonstrate this effect in a Polypyrrole/ Polydimethylsiloxane complex by using a novel magnetic pulse system. The frequency spectrum of the current flowing through the sample reveals equally spaced reversed peaks in the current. We show that these peaks happen at the Lamour frequency for the dominant charge carrier of the system, namely polarons. This posits the origin Organic magnetoresistance as simple Rabi Oscillations rather than mechanisms based of bipolaron formation and singlet-triplet conversions. We directly estimate the effective polaronic mass in this complex. A semi classical theoretical approach is suggested to explain this effect as direct spin flipping in a time transient magnetic field. This is the first time that such an experimental approach has been applied in this field and the first time the effective polaronic mass has been measured in a conducting polymer.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linear Foundation Model for Quantum Embedding: Data-Driven Compression of the Ghost Gutzwiller Variational Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21666</link><description>arXiv:2512.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of quantum matter rely mainly on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), which often fails for strongly correlated systems. Quantum embedding (QE) theories address this limitation by mapping the system onto an auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) describing fragment-environment interactions, but the EH is typically large and its iterative solution is the primary computational bottleneck. We introduce a linear foundation model for QE that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the space of quantum states needed to solve the EH within a small variational subspace. Using a data-driven active-learning scheme, we learn this subspace from EH ground states and reduce each embedding solve to a deterministic ground-state eigenvalue problem in the reduced space. Within the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (ghost-GA), we show for a three-orbital Hubbard model that a variational space learned on a Bethe lattice is transferable to square and cubic lattices without additional training, while substantially reducing the cost of the EH step. We further validate the approach on plutonium, where a single variational space reproduces the energetics of all six crystalline phases while reducing the cost of the EH solution by orders of magnitude. This provides a practical route to overcome the main computational bottleneck of QE frameworks, paving the way for high-throughput ab initio simulations of strongly correlated materials at a near-DFT cost.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21666v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect Engineering for Stabilizing Magnetic and Topological Properties in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21680</link><description>arXiv:2512.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 is a versatile platform for exploring diverse topological quantum states, yet its potential is hampered by intrinsic antisite defects. While Sb substitution has been employed to tune the Fermi level towards the charge neutral point, it exacerbates the formation of Mn-Sb antisite defects. Here, we address this challenge by combining first-principles calculations with strategic synthesis to systematically investigate and control antisite defects in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4. Our calculations reveal that increasing antisite defect density progressively destroys the field-forced magnetic Weyl state, eventually driving the system into a trivial magnetic insulator. Motivated by these findings, we develop an optimized chemical vapor transport method, yielding high-quality Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 crystals with significantly reduced antisite defect density. The emergence of strong Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the forced ferromagnetic state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect near charge neutrality, with opposite signs for n- and p-type samples, confirms the type-II Weyl semimetal nature. These findings underscore the critical role of antisite defects in determining the magnetic and topological properties of Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 and establish defect engineering via optimized synthesis as a crucial strategy for realizing its exotic magnetic topological states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum tunneling and defect-induced transport modulation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21790</link><description>arXiv:2512.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunable Magnetic and Topological Phases in EuMnXBi$_2$ (X=Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) Pnictides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21978</link><description>arXiv:2512.21978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of the layered pnictides EuMnXBi2 (X = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn), focusing in particular on the relatively unexplored Bi-based member of the EuMn2X2 family. Unlike the well-studied As-, Sb-, and P--based analogues, we show that EuMn2Bi2 stabilizes in a C-type antiferromagnetic ground state with a narrow-gap semiconducting character. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) drives a transition from this trivial antiferromagnetic semiconductor to a Weyl semimetal hosting four symmetry-related Weyl points and robust Fermi arc states. Systematic substitution of Mn with Fe, Co, and Zn further reveals a tunable sequence of magnetic ground states: Fe and Co induce ferrimagnetism with semimetallic behavior, while Zn stabilizes a ferromagnetic semimetal with a large net moment. These findings establish Bi-based EuMnXBi2 pnictides as a versatile platform where magnetic exchange interactions and band topology can be engineered through SOC and chemical substitution. The complex interplay of magnetic interactions and topological effects in the proposed bulk and doped pnictides opens a promising avenue to explore a wide range of electronic and magnetic phenomena. In particular, this study demonstrates that EuMn2Bi2 hosts tunable magnetic and topological phases driven by electron correlations, chemical substitution, and spin-orbit coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectricity in magnon Bose-Einstein condensate: non-reciprocal superfluidity, exceptional points and Majorana bosons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22073</link><description>arXiv:2512.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a ferroelectric instability of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensate, mediated by its interaction with an electric field through a geometric Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. A distinct feature of the system is the positive feedback loop in which an electric field induces magnon orbital motion via the AC phase, generating electric polarization that in turn enhances the original field. Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point. The corresponding eigenvector is an equally weighted superposition of bosonic quasiparticle and quasihole states and is invariant under particle-hole transformation, allowing it to be interpreted as a bosonic analog of a Majorana fermion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bose polarons as relativistic Unruh-DeWitt detectors: Entanglement harvesting from Bose-Einstein condensates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21381</link><description>arXiv:2512.21381v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: The notion of quantum symmetry has recently been extended to include reduced-dimensional transformations and algebraic structures beyond groups. Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21436v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21808</link><description>arXiv:2512.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21808v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Digital-Alloy Bragg Mirrors in High-Q Microcavities for Polariton Lasing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03203</link><description>arXiv:2512.03203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to the molecular-beam epitaxy of high-Q planar GaAs-based microcavities in which the AlGaAs high-index layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are replaced by short-period GaAs/AlAs superlattices (digital alloys) with similar optical properties. This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters.
  Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 570 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03203v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First principle study of electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) full Heusler: Application to embedded automotive systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07471</link><description>arXiv:2512.07471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, theoretical investigation on structural, electronic, magnetic, elastic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) alloys have been performed within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07471v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Shape descriptors of equilibrium states in a quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials: A geometric analysis near the phase transitions in Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12338</link><description>arXiv:2512.12338v2 Announce Type: replace

The elastic constants and other mechanical parameters were computed by utilizing the ELAST code within the WIEN2k software, while the thermodynamic characteristics were evaluated using the Gibbs2 program. The findings show a correlation between atomic composition and lattice dimensions while finding that CaZnC has a direct ($\Gamma$-$\Gamma$) band gap of $1.186$ eV, whereas CaZnSi has an indirect ($\Gamma$-$X$) band gap of $1.067$ eV. The optical studies of the compounds show potential applications for photovoltaics while the thermoelectric results find optimized power factors and figure of merit values for energy conversion performance. The elastic parameters of CaZnC and CaZnSi demonstrate material stability and brittleness. Lastly, the thermodynamic evaluations provide information about the thermal mechanism and disorder of the materials. As a result, this research work provides significant advancements in the understanding of the fundamentals of these compounds and highlights their promising applications in renewable energy technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15822v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Parameterized Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Approach to Simulate van der Waals Interactions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zz4xz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The strong coupling between light and matter inside optical cavities has emerged as a strategy to modify the chemical and physical properties of materials. In this work, we explore the performance of the recently developed parameterized quantum electrodynamics (pQED) approach based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for non-covalently interacting systems, including van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions.  We find that the pQED-TDDFT approach accurately reproduces the cavity-modified potential energy surfaces of the polaritonic ground state, compared with high-level QED coupled-cluster and state-of-the-art QED density functional theory results. By computing the ground-state density difference, we show that the dispersion-energy modifications are due to electronic density redistribution inside the cavity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zz4xz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Cobalt-Catalyzed Intramolecular C−H Silylation of Arenes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5h79?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Direct C−Si bond formation via C−H silylation offers an efficient atom-economical route to organosilanes, yet existing strategies remain largely restricted to noble-metal catalysis. Here, we disclose the first cobalt-catalyzed intramolecular C−H silylation of arenes, enabled by the well-defined hydride complex HCo(PMe3)4. This catalyst sequentially activates Si−H and arene C–H bonds, enabling either an hydrosilylation/cyclization sequence or direct cyclization. The method features broad functional-group tolerance and delivers diverse heterosilacycles and silafluorenes in high yields and can be extended to germacycle. DFT studies support a two-electron mechanism involving oxidative addition of the Si–H bond, H2 elimination facilitated by a hydrogen acceptor, intramolecular C−H activation to form a cobaltacycle, and final reductive elimination to furnish the silacycle. Overall, this work establishes cobalt hydrides as a sustainable and effective alternative to noble metals for the synthesis of silacyclic architectures.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5h79?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Three pressure cycles were conducted with compression rates ranging from 0.1 to nearly 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; GPa/s. During the first cycle with the slowest compression, the observed orientations in the bcc and hcp phases are consistent with the Burgers mechanism, followed by &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis rotation of the hcp phase consistent with {10 1¯2} twinning. During the following cycles with fast compression at 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; GPa/s, the hcp phase exhibits negligible &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis rotation with a nearly constant &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; ratio of ∼1.61 up to ∼30 GPa, indicating suppression of plastic deformation (especially, twinning) due to sample confinement from the gasket. Notably, the onset pressure of the transition decreases with additional pressure cycling and faster compression, which normally leads to over-pressurization. This suggests that defects or shear induced from the pressure cycling reduces the transition kinetics even during fast compression. These insights into the deformation and transition behavior in an FeNi alloy under multiple dynamic loading cycles can offer guidance for future design of advanced structural alloys and improve our understanding of planetary core processes.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/261901/3375673/Effect-of-pressure-cycling-and-compression-rate-on</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Thin Ga 2 O 3  insertion layer for phase structure and electrical property evolutions in ferroelectric Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2  capacitors</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262901/3375669/Thin-Ga2O3-insertion-layer-for-phase-structure-and</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;In this study, gallium oxide (Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) insertion layers (ILs) of varying thicknesses were embedded within Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HZO) films using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Devices with Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ILs grown for fewer than 4 ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles exhibit a reduction in both remnant polarization (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and coercive field (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;). Notably, the device incorporating a IL with 2 ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles demonstrates strong performance, achieving a 2&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of 47.0 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.92 MV/cm. In contrast, for devices with ILs exceeding 8 ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles, the 2&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; value remains near 18 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; increases significantly. These divergent behaviors can be attributed to the different diffusion states of the insertion IL. For a low number of ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles, it is the diffusion of Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into the HZO region adjacent to the IL that results in a reduced &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, with higher ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles, the IL forms a continuous layer that physically divides the 10 nm HZO film into two sections, which leads to a further decrease in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and an increase in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the progressive disruption of vertical grain boundaries by the growing insertion layer (IL) leads to a continuous decrease in leakage current.

Particularly, the  κ values at room temperature for Ta-based samples are in the range observed in materials already employed as thermoelectric devices, suggesting they are potential candidates as a starting point for thermoelectric applications. Here, we investigate their phonon dynamics through a combination of Raman scattering measurements with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For the Ta-based compounds only, our results reveal the presence of an  Eg low-energy optical phonon that softens by  ∼10 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; upon cooling from 300 to 15 K, indicating this is a zone-center soft mode associated with an unrealized structural phase transition. The soft mode enhances the phonon density of states at low energies, as directly manifested in the second-order Raman scattering data and also captured by DFT phonon calculations. These results provide insights into the low  κ-values of Ta-based trirutiles and place zone-center soft phonons as a key ingredient for the development of novel thermoelectric materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262201/3375664/Soft-phonon-mode-as-the-origin-of-the-reduced</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Nonvolatile spin logic-in-memory strategy by fully electrically multistate modulation in two-dimensional A-type antiferromagnets</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/263501/3375661/Nonvolatile-spin-logic-in-memory-strategy-by-fully</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Achieving spin logic-in-memory computing architectures by full-electrical higher-order multistate modulation at the nanoscale is highly pursued in next-generation energy-efficient information technology.

Experimental results demonstrate the device's capability to modulate channel conductance, achieve multi-level memory states, and exhibit synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation and depression under variable gate voltages and light intensities. Furthermore, the proposed FeFETs can be trained and recognize handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset with an excellent recognition accuracy of 94.8%.

We report comprehensive benchmarks demonstrating favorable scaling with respect to system size, as well as high throughput for batched evaluations relevant to molecular dynamics, geometry optimization, and large-scale virtual screening.

Abstract: Simulations of SiC crystal growth using molecular dynamics (MD) have become popular in recent years. They, however, simulate very fast deposition rates, to reduce computational costs. Therefore, they are more akin to surface sputtering, leading to abnormal growth effects, including thick amorphous layers and large defect densities. A recently developed method, called the minimum energy atomic deposition (MEAD), tries to overcome this problem by depositing the atoms directly at the minimum energy positions, increasing the time scale.
  We apply the MEAD method to simulate SiC crystal growth on stepped C-terminated 4H substrates with 4{\deg} and 8{\deg} off-cut angle. We explore relevant calculations settings, such as amount of equilibration steps between depositions and influence of simulation cell sizes and bench mark different interatomic potentials. The carefully calibrated methodology is able to replicate the stable step-flow growth, which was so far not possible using conventional MD simulations. Furthermore, the simulated crystals are evaluated in terms of their dislocations, surface roughness and atom mobility. Our methodology paves the way for future high fidelity investigations of surface phenomena in crystal growth.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link><description>arXiv:2512.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering experiments through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like statistics can also arise from a purely local, dynamical mechanism, which we elucidate using a minimal Lorenz-like model of a walking droplet. In this model, a localized defect perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This attractor-driven, local mechanism opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs based on active particles with internal degrees of freedom.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] From cluster to nanocrystal: the continuous evolution and critical size of copper clusters revealed by machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21067</link><description>arXiv:2512.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of cluster structure with size and the critical size for the transition from cluster to nanocrystal have long been fundamental problems in nanoscience. Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 &lt;= N &lt;= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N &lt; 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N &gt; 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 &lt;= N &lt;= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active Learning Guided Computational Discovery of 2D Materials with Large Spin Hall Conductivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21077</link><description>arXiv:2512.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices due to their tunable properties and potential for efficient spin-charge interconversion. However, discovering materials with intrinsically high spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is hindered by the vast chemical space and expensive nature of conventional experimental and first-principles methods. In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20785</link><description>arXiv:2512.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231</link><description>arXiv:2512.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13484</link><description>arXiv:2508.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work (Islam et al., 2025) showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. The simulations employ systems containing 2.4 million atoms and utilize a machine learning interatomic potential optimized to capture chemical complexity through the motif-based sampling technique. Using information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with processing parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13484v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Moir\'e spintronics: Emergent phenomena, material realization and machine learning accelerating discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04045</link><description>arXiv:2509.04045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena and engineering novel material properties in two dimensions, potentially revolutionizing developments in spintronics. This Review provides an overview of recent progress on emerging moir\'e spintronics in twisted vdW materials, with a particular focus on two-dimensional magnetic materials. Following a brief introduction to the general features of twisted vdW materials, we discuss recent theoretical and experimental studies on stacking-dependent interlayer magnetism, non-collinear spin textures, moir\'e magnetic exchange interactions, moir\'e skyrmions and moir\'e magnons. We further highlight the potential of machine learning to accelerate the discovery and design of multifunctional materials for moir\'e spintronics. Finally, we conclude by addressing the most pressing challenges and potential opportunities in this rapidly expanding field.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04045v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Inter-defect interactions, oxygen-vacancy distribution, and oxidation in acceptor-doped ABO3 perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20693</link><description>arXiv:2512.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of inter-defect interaction on the defect thermodynamics, local structure, and oxidation of acceptor-doped wide-gap ABO3 perovskites are explored using the developed statistical theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deciphering the lattice vibrational behaviors of CuInP2S6 by angle-resolved polarized Raman scattering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20925</link><description>arXiv:2512.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) exhibits unique cation hopping-driven phenomena that bring about unconventional properties with intriguing mechanisms and hold promises for advanced applications in nanoelectronics. However, an explicit analysis of its lattice dynamics and vibrational symmetries, pivotal for understanding the material's peculiar ferroelectric and ferroionic behaviors, remains incomplete. Here, we employ angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy in concert with first-principles calculations to systematically unravel the anisotropic lattice vibrations of CIPS single crystals. By analyzing the polarization-dependent Raman intensities, we determine the symmetry assignments and Raman tensors of all major vibrational modes, revealing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and non-invasive probe for structural and ferroelectric order evolution, by examining temperature-driven phase transitions and thickness-dependent polarization suppression in CIPS. Our findings establish a foundational framework for correlating lattice dynamics with functional properties in CIPS and provide a methodological blueprint for studying other vdW ferroelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Substrate Role in Polaron Formation on Single-layer Transition Metal Dihalides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21163</link><description>arXiv:2512.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer transition metal dihalides grown on conducting substrates were shown to host stable polarons. Here, we investigate polarons in insulating single-layer MnBr$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on three different substrates, namely graphene on Ir(110), graphene on Ir(111), and Au(111). The number densities and species of polarons observed vary strongly as a function of the substrate. For MnBr$_2$ grown on Ir(110) the largest number of polaron species is observed, namely four, of which three show clear similarities with the species observed for CoCl$_2$ on graphite. Polarons in single-layer MnBr$_2$ are observed up to 300K. They can be created, converted, and moved by the STM tip when a tunneling current flows at a proper bias voltage. For graphene on Ir(110) as a substrate, mobile polarons in MnBr$_2$ are guided through the periodic potential imposed from the super-moir\'e resulting from the interaction of MnBr$_2$ with graphene and Ir(110). Our findings indicate that modeling of polarons in such single-layer insulators in contact with a conducting substrate requires to take the substrate explicitly into account.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PhononBench:A Large-Scale Phonon-Based Benchmark for Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21227</link><description>arXiv:2512.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

Abstract: As we move beyond the era of transistor miniaturization, back-end-of-line-compatible transistors that can be stacked monolithically in the third dimension promise improved performance for low-power electronics. In advanced transistor architectures, such as gate-all-around nanosheets, the conventional channel-first process involves depositing dielectrics directly onto the channel. Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($&gt;$ 1 mA/$\mu$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic sampling of materials using neutral-atom quantum computers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21142</link><description>arXiv:2512.21142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $\alpha_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = \alpha_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $\Delta_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $\Delta\mu$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical arrest in active nematic turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15149</link><description>arXiv:2407.15149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluids display spontaneous turbulent-like flows known as active turbulence. Recent work revealed that these flows have universal features, independent of the material properties and of the presence of topological defects. However, the differences between defect-laden and defect-free active turbulence remain largely unexplored. Here, by means of large-scale numerical simulations, we show that defect-free active nematic turbulence can undergo dynamical arrest. This state is characterized by an emergent network of nematic domain walls that channels coherent streams and suppresses chaotic flows. As the system evolves, the branched wall network produces a large-scale pattern with tree-like topological properties. We find that flow alignment -- the tendency of nematics to reorient under shear -- enhances large-scale chaotic jets in contractile rodlike systems while promoting dynamical arrest in extensile systems. We further show that dynamical arrest persists regardless of whether defects are prohibited by construction or simply fail to form due to a high energy cost of defect cores. Taken together, our findings reveal a striking pattern-formation mechanism, with labyrinths emerging from active turbulence, and illuminate the rich transitional regime between defect-free and defect-laden dynamics. These behaviors call for the experimental realization of active nematics at vanishing or low defect densities, and underscore that, in extensile rodlike nematics, topological defects enable turbulence by preventing dynamical arrest.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.15149v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GEARS H: Accurate machine-learned Hamiltonians for next-generation device-scale modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10298</link><description>arXiv:2506.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10298v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07187</link><description>arXiv:2508.07187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07187v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Single-hole spectral functions in 1D quantum magnets with different ground states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20447</link><description>arXiv:2511.20447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,\omega)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,\tau)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,\omega)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.20447v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acoustoelectric Probing of Fractal Energy Spectra in Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06313</link><description>arXiv:2512.06313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\'e superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moir\'e-engineered 2D systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06313v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn) Heusler alloys as candidate materials for spintronic and microelectronic applications: Electronic structure, transport, and magnetism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20358</link><description>arXiv:2512.20358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $\Gamma$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20358v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Machine learning-assisted kinetic matching model for rational electrode design in aqueous zinc-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67996-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 25 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67996-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67996-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are safe and affordable but limited by incompatible electrode kinetics.

Abstract: Enhancing the kinetic stability of glasses often necessitates deepening thermodynamic stability, which typically compromises ductility due to increased structural rigidity. Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs. This work establishes a paradigm of kinetic stabilization without thermodynamic compromise, offering a roadmap to additively manufacture bulk amorphous materials with combined hyperstability and plasticity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Composition-Based Machine Learning for Screening Superconducting Ternary Hydrides from a Curated Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20228</link><description>arXiv:2512.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ensemble machine-learning approach for composition-based, structure-agnostic screening of candidate superconductors among ternary hydrides under high pressure. Hydrogen-rich hydrides are known to exhibit high superconducting transition temperatures, and ternary or multinary hydrides can stabilize superconducting phases at reduced pressures through chemical compression. To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of ensemble-based machine learning as a primary screening tool for identifying promising regions of chemical space in superconducting hydrides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Elemental Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20230</link><description>arXiv:2512.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Iterative learning scheme for crystal structure prediction with anharmonic lattice dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20424</link><description>arXiv:2512.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fundamentals of quantum Boltzmann machine learning with visible and hidden units</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19819</link><description>arXiv:2512.19819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19819v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link><description>arXiv:2506.10965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10965v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link><description>arXiv:2507.09001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic structure underpins advances in chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the development of powerful surrogate models that can enable the prediction of the ground state electron density and related properties at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional first principles simulations. Such ML models typically rely on massive datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculations. A key reason for relying on such large datasets is the lack of prior knowledge about which portions of the data are essential, and which are redundant. This study reveals significant redundancies in electronic structure datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and chemically complex alloys -- challenging the notion that extensive datasets are essential for accurate ML-based electronic structure predictions. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy that selects data across all learning difficulties, retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data, while reducing training time by threefold or greater. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate easy-to-learn data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors due to significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.09001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Domain Wall-mediated Interfacial Ferroelectric Switching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11997</link><description>arXiv:2508.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have demonstrated the importance of domain wall in polarization switching, the coexistence of various domain wall types and their impact on polarization stability lacks fundamental understanding. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls connect opposite polarization states and respond to out-of-plane electric field through polarization vector deviation, leading to inhomogeneous interlayer sliding and domain-wall migration. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, which are supported by our experimental observations. These insights shed light on the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, offering guidance for future nanoelectronics applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.11997v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06459</link><description>arXiv:2510.06459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06459v4</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: eScience] Achieving high-voltage polymer-based all-solid-state batteries based on thermodynamic and kinetic degradation insights</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725000631?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; eScience, Volume 6, Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Xiaoyan Yu, Yun Su, Hang Su, Ruizhi Liu, Jingyi Qiu, Xiayu Zhu, Rui Wen, Hao Zhang, Xiaohui Rong, Yong-Sheng Hu, Gaoping Cao&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: eScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:38:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725000631</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Chemical Reactivity Mapping: Exploring Chemical Reaction based on Digitalization of Small Molecules through Mayr’s Parameter</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1r6gz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>A new strategy for exploring novel reactions, utilizing Mayr’s reactivity parameters, is developed.

Recent discoveries of numerous second-generation ligands for Cu-mediated Ullmann-type cross-coupling reactions have broadened the scope to include less reactive aryl halides and nucleophiles and have also enabled lower copper and ligand loadings in these processes. However, in contrast to Pd chemistry, in-silico workflows for guiding systematic ligand selection from early-stage screening through optimization remain significantly less developed for Cu-catalyzed C-O and C-N bond coupling reactions. This report describes the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for streamlining ligand selection in Cu-catalyzed Ullmann-type coupling reactions. It provides a “map” of more than 80 ligands used in Ullmann couplings and is designed to reveal reactivity trends and highlight areas of high and low yields, thereby facilitating prioritization of high-value experiments in both medicinal and process chemistry settings. Validation for C-N and C-O couplings is provided using literature datasets, along with the development and application of a PCA-guided screening set for Ullmann couplings.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rqcts?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] High-throughput computational framework for high-order anharmonic thermal transport in cubic and tetragonal crystals</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01920-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 24 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01920-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-025-01920-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;High-throughput computational framework for high-order anharmonic thermal transport in cubic and tetragonal crystals</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01920-y</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Stepwise Zn(II) Coordination in a TPMA-Based Chiral Cage Probed by Circular Dichroism</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs6n6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The stepwise coordination of Zn(II) within a chiral cage featuring two intrinsic tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) binding sites was investigated using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) and TD-DFT calculations. NMR titrations reveal a sequential two-step metalation process, influenced by solvent polarity. The CD evolution mirrors this progression, showing well-defined isodichroic points and gradual blue-shift of the main bands. DFT optimizations indicate that Zn(II) coordination is accompanied by a progressive opening and rigidification of the TPMA arms, while TD-DFT simulations reproduce the observed redistribution of ECD intensities, consistent with changes in chromophore orientation and electronic coupling. These results define a relationship between metalation dynamics, structural reorganization and chiroptical response, illustrating how subtle structural changes at the coordination sites translate into measurable optical differences.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs6n6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Nature of Surface Sites in Ziegler-Natta Pre-Catalysts from Quanti-tative Analysis of Ti K-edge X-Ray Absorption Spectra</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2dv1x-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ziegler-Natta catalysts, discovered in 1950s, are still nowadays central to the industrial production of polyethylene and polypropylene. Despite being the workhorse of the polymer industry and despite years of extensive research, the improvement of Ziegler-Natta catalysts has been mostly empirical. In particular, the coordination surrounding of Ti sites in pre-catalysts, key for the formation of active sites upon AlEt3 activation, has been highly debated. Notably, quantification of different Ti sites on the MgCl2 surface has not been possible so far, hindering the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships. In this work, we prepared a series of pre-catalysts with increasing concentration of BCl3 modifier during the catalyst synthesis, known to affect the amount of Cl- and alkoxo-ligands in the Ti local surrounding as well as the activity in ethylene polymerization. We develop a methodology, relying on a library of theoretical XAS spectra for DFT-optimized structural models, benchmarked on a series of well-defined molecular compounds. Quantitative analysis of XAS data allows us to evaluate the relative fractions of Ti sites in fully Cl-surrounding as well as containing alkoxide and O-donor ligands. The analysis shows that the number of Ti-O bonds (initially mostly present in their alkoxo-form) decreases upon treatment with BCl3 up to B/Ti ratio of 2, coherent with earlier proposals, and increases afterwards, due to O-donor ligands, likely related to B-alkoxo species coordinated to Ti. The catalytic activity of these pre-catalysts after activation with AlEt3 in ethylene polymerization passes through a maximum at B/Ti ratio of ~2, pointing to its relation to the detrimental effect of O-based ligands on the activity. This approach allows to address and quantify the metal speciation in the complex Ziegler-Natta pre-catalysts and relate this to their catalytic activity, a first step towards establishing quantitative structure-activity relationships.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2dv1x-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Structure Revision of Isomallotusinin to Mallotusinin by NMR-Based Conformational Analysis</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xsgqb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>A reexamination of the reported structure of isomallotusinin, previously proposed as an anomer of the ellagitannin mallotusinin, demonstrates that this compound is identical to mallotusinin, thus correcting a structural misassignment. This conclusion is supported by a detailed conformational analysis of mallotusinin, which bears a distinctive tetrahydroxydibenzofuranoyl (THDBF) group. Through a DFT-assisted analysis of 1H–1H coupling constants, we demonstrate that mallotusinin exists as a solvent-dependent equilibrium of 3S1 and 1C4 conformers. Our findings resolve a structural ambiguity in the literature and highlight the importance of considering conformational dynamics in the structural elucidation of conformationally flexible ellagitannins.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xsgqb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Graph-Based Internal Coordinate Analysis for Transition State Characterisation</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-k69gt-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We present graphRC, a graph-based method for rapid transition state (TS) mode analysis that provides chemical insight along normal mode displacements and reaction coordinate trajectories by translating Cartesian displacements into meaningful internal coordinate changes. Internal coordinates are constructed using xyzgraph, a flexible graph-based approach that achieves 98.4% agreement with DFT and 99.8% with existing methods across 4846 structures. Initial validation on 16 diverse TS achieved 100% identification of bond changes, rotations and inversions with zero false positives. Expansion to 395 diverse TS demonstrated robust performance, with 100.0% detection of the primary bond change and an overall agreement of 88.4% with Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) connectivity across 984 vibrational bonds. This approach enables programmatic TS verification and rapid reaction coordinate analysis in seconds, complementing more rigorous IRC and Quick Reaction Coordinate (QRC) methods while delivering robust, interpretable TS analysis across diverse chemical systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-k69gt-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Extra hole threshold in HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ferroelectric phase stabilization</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02438-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 24 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02438-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-025-02438-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stabilizing the ferroelectric phase in HfO2 is a critical challenge for its application in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a fundamental problem in materials science. We present CrystalFormer-CSP, an efficient framework that unifies data-driven heuristic and physics-driven optimization approaches to predict stable crystal structures for given chemical compositions. The approach combines pretrained generative models for space-group-informed structure generation and a universal machine learning force field for energy minimization. Reinforcement fine-tuning can be employed to further boost the accuracy of the framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrystalFormer-CSP on benchmark problems and showcase its usage via web interface and language model integration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin Reorientation Driven Renormalization of Spin-Phonon Coupling in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18544</link><description>arXiv:2512.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tackling dataset curation challenges towards reliable machine learning: a case study on thermoelectric materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18653</link><description>arXiv:2512.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) driven discovery of novel and efficient thermoelectric (TE) materials warrants experimental TE datasets of high volume, diversity, and quality. While the largest publicly available dataset, Starrydata2, has a high data volume, it contains inaccurate data due to the inherent limitations of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted data curation, ambiguous nomenclature and complex formulas of materials in the literature. Another unaddressed issue is the inclusion of multi-source experimental data, with high standard deviations and without synthesis information. Using half-Heusler (hH) materials as an example, this work is aimed at first highlighting these errors and inconsistencies which cannot be filtered with conventional dataset curation workflows. We then propose a statistical round-robin error-based data filtering method to address these issues, a method that can be applied to filter any other material property. Lastly, a hybrid dataset creation workflow, involving data from Starrydata2 and manual extraction, is proposed and the resulting dataset is analyzed and compared against Starrydata2.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological surface phonons modulate thermal transport in semiconductor thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18757</link><description>arXiv:2512.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While phonon topology in crystalline solids has been extensively studied, its influence on thermal transport-especially in nanostructures-remains elusive. Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18757v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link><description>arXiv:2512.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Long-range electrostatics for machine learning interatomic potentials is easier than we thought</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18029</link><description>arXiv:2512.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of long-range electrostatics is a key limitation of modern machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), hindering reliable applications to interfaces, charge-transfer reactions, polar and ionic materials, and biomolecules. In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microstructure-based Variational Neural Networks for Robust Uncertainty Quantification in Materials Digital Twins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18104</link><description>arXiv:2512.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aleatoric uncertainties - irremovable variability in microstructure morphology, constituent behavior, and processing conditions - pose a major challenge to developing uncertainty-robust digital twins. We introduce the Variational Deep Material Network (VDMN), a physics-informed surrogate model that enables efficient and probabilistic forward and inverse predictions of material behavior. The VDMN captures microstructure-induced variability by embedding variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture. Using an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation, the VDMN efficiently propagates uncertainty through the network during training and prediction. We demonstrate its capabilities in two digital-twin-driven applications: (1) as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, it predicts and experimentally validates the nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites; and (2) as an inverse calibration engine, it disentangles and quantitatively identifies overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties. Together, these results establish the VDMN as a foundation for uncertainty-robust materials digital twins.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lattice-Renormalized Tunneling Models for Superconducting Qubit Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18156</link><description>arXiv:2512.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice-renormalized formalism for configurational tunneling two-level systems (TLS) that overcomes limitations of minimum-energy-path and light-particle models. Derived from the nuclear Hamiltonian, our formulation introduces composite phonon coordinates to capture lattice distortions between degenerate potential wells. This approach resolves deficiencies in prior models and enables accurate computation of tunnel splittings and excitation spectra for hydrogen-based TLS in bcc Nb. Our results bound experimental tunnel splittings and reveal strong anharmonic couplings between tunneling atoms and lattice phonons, establishing a direct link between TLS dynamics and phonon-mediated strain interactions. The formalism further generalizes to multi-level systems (MLS), providing insight into defect-induced decoherence in superconducting qubits and guiding strategies for materials design to suppress TLS-related loss.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Agentic Framework for Autonomous Materials Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19458</link><description>arXiv:2512.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating scientific discovery, yet their static knowledge and hallucination issues hinder autonomous research applications. Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations. By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Block-copolymer electrolytes with lamellar microstructure show promising results regarding the ion transport in experiments. Motivated by these observations we study block-copolymers consisting of a polystyrene (PS) block and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block which were assembled in a lamellar structure. The lamella was doped with various amounts of lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) until very high loadings with ratios of EO monomers to cations up to 1:1 were reached. We present insights into the structure and ion transport from extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. For high salt concentrations most cations are not coordinated by PEO but rather by TFSI and THF. More specifically, LiTFSI partially separates from the PEO domain and forms a network-like structure in the middle of the lamella. This central salt-rich layer plays a decisive role to enable remarkably good cationic mobilities as well as high transport numbers in agreement with the experimental results.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2010.11673v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of multiple flat bands and van Hove singularities in the distorted kagome metal NdTi3Bi4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11488</link><description>arXiv:2311.11488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials have attracted enormous research interest recently owing to their diverse topological phases and manifestation of electronic correlation. Here, we present the electronic structure of a distorted ferromagnetic kagome metal, NdTi3Bi4, exhibiting a transition temperature of 9 K. Our investigation employs a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover the presence of two flat bands which are found to originate from the kagome structure formed by Ti atoms with major contribution from Ti dxy and Ti dx2-y2 orbitals. We also observed multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the Fermi level. The ARPES data reveals the existence of Dirac cone at the K point, a finding which is corroborated by our DFT calculations. These findings present detailed electronic structure capable of hosting correlation-driven phenomenon in this novel ferromagnetic kagome metal.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.11488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep Variational Free Energy Calculation of Hydrogen Hugoniot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18540</link><description>arXiv:2507.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model for the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow model for the unitary backflow transformation of electron coordinates in Hartree-Fock states. By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen for the temperature range where electrons occupy excited states. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. Our results bridge the gap between the results obtained by path-integral Monte Carlo calculations at high temperature and ground-state electronic methods at low temperature, thus providing a valuable benchmark for hydrogen in the warm dense matter region.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18540v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114</link><description>arXiv:2509.05114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.05114v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep learning directed synthesis of fluid ferroelectric materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16671</link><description>arXiv:2512.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16671v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anti-Correlated Noise in Epoch-Based Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implications for Weight Variances in Flat Directions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05300</link><description>arXiv:2306.05300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization due to its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.05300v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unified Micromechanics Theory of Composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14529</link><description>arXiv:2503.14529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14529v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Separating water content from network dynamics in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17362</link><description>arXiv:2504.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing forces, deformations and generally speaking the mechanical properties of cells is the hallmark of mechanobiology. In the last two decades many techniques have been developed to this end that are largely based on deforming the cells and measuring the reaction force. In cells, an alternative approach has been implemented mid 2010's, based on Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) that produces a spectrum that can be interpreted as the response of the sample to an infinitesimal uniaxial compression at picosecond timescales. In all of these measurements, the response of the cell is quantified with a colloquial "stiffness" that encompasses both the contribution of load-bearing structures and volume changes, much to confusion. To clarify the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that BLS shift alone is mostly sensitive to water content while the additional analysis of the linewidth allows identifying the contribution of the biopolymer-based network dynamics in living cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17362v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] BOOM: Benchmarking Out-Of-distribution Molecular Property Predictions of Machine Learning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01912</link><description>arXiv:2505.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven molecular discovery leverages artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and generative modeling to filter and design novel molecules. Discovering novel molecules requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, but ML models struggle to generalize OOD. Currently, no systematic benchmarks exist for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present $\mathbf{BOOM}$, $\mathbf{b}$enchmarks for $\mathbf{o}$ut-$\mathbf{o}$f-distribution $\mathbf{m}$olecular property predictions: a chemically-informed benchmark for OOD performance on common molecular property prediction tasks. We evaluate over 150 model-task combinations to benchmark deep learning models on OOD performance. Overall, we find that no existing model achieves strong generalization across all tasks: even the top-performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x higher than in-distribution. Current chemical foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation, while models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. We perform extensive ablation experiments, highlighting how data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation impact OOD performance. Developing models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors. Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.07150v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonreciprocal yet Symmetric Multi-Species Active Matter: Emergence of Chirality and Species Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18749</link><description>arXiv:2512.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal active matter systems typically feature an asymmetric role among interacting agents, such as a pursuer-evader relationship. We propose a multi-species nonreciprocal active matter model that is invariant under permutations of the particle species. The nonreciprocal, yet symmetric, interactions emerge from a constant phase shift in the velocity alignment interactions, rather than from an asymmetric coupling matrix. This system possessing permutation symmetry displays rich collective behaviors, including a species-mixed chiral phase with quasi-long-range polar order and a species separation phase characterized by vortex cells. The system also displays a coexistence phase of the chiral and the species separation phases, in which intriguing dynamic patterns emerge. These rich collective behaviors are a consequence of the interplay between nonreciprocity and permutation symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside through fluoride doping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19014</link><description>arXiv:2512.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the divide: Economic exchange and segregation in dual-income cities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18680</link><description>arXiv:2512.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segregation is a growing concern around the world. One of its main manifestations is the creation of ghettos, whose inhabitants have difficult access to well-paid jobs, which are often located far from their homes. In order to study this phenomenon, we propose an extension of Schelling's model of segregation to take into account the existence of economic exchanges. To approximate a geographical model of the city, we consider a small-world network with a defined real estate market. The evolution of the system has also been studied, finding that economic exchanges follow exponential laws and relocations are approximated by power laws. In addition to this, we consider the existence of delays in the actions of the agents, which mainly affect the happiness of those with fewer economic resources. Besides, the size of the economic exchange plays a crucial role in overall segregation. Despite its simplicity, we find that our model reproduces real-world situations such as the separation between favoured and handicapped economic areas, the importance of economic contacts between them to improve the distribution of wealth, and the existence of efficient and cheap transport to break the poverty cycles typical of disadvantaged zones.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Information Supercurrents in Chiral Active Matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link><description>arXiv:2512.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative (phase rigidity) information supercurrents, analogous to a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically and empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16884v2</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Materials] In situ polymerization for high performance solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01035-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Materials, Published online: 23 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01035-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s43246-025-01035-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries promise high energy density, long-term performance, and enhanced safety, but face challenges with interfacial issues due to poor solid–solid contact.

This perspective argues that time-dependent structural change is a crucial, but often overlooked, mechanistic feature as many reactions simply do not follow a single, equilibrated minimum-energy path. We highlight examples where traditional transition state theory fails, typically cases involving short-lived interme-diates, non-equilibrium solvation, momentum-controlled selectivity, post-transition state bifurcations, and “hidden” dy-namic intermediates and show how molecular dynamics can reveal the actual sequence of structural change which gov-erns a reaction outcome. We also discuss emerging machine learning-based molecular dynamics which have found appli-cations in photochemistry and solvent modelling. While molecular dynamics will not replace methods based on transi-tion state theory, it offers organic chemists a time-resolved view of molecular structure which can be crucial to under-standing a given reaction. However, a central barrier for organic chemists is to understand when and why to apply an ad-vanced computational technique such as molecular dynamics simulations. In this perspective, we aim to introduce the methodology in sufficient detail to enable organic chemists to make this assessment and gain an appreciation for the im-portance of time in reaction mechanisms.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fclzt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Characterisation and immobilisation study of the Haloperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis: application to phenol derivatives</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jcmpt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In the past decades, usage of enzymes to catalyse halogenation reactions has emerged as a greener approach compared to usual ones using toxic reagents and yielding to a bad atom economy. Vanadium dependent haloperoxidases (VDHals) are the most commonly used enzymes for such transformations in organic chemistry due to their robustness. Among them, haloperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) is the most cited in the literature but only barely characterized aside from its substrate spectrum and kinetic parameters. In the present study, we evaluated the melting temperature, thermostability, thermoactivity and solvent stability of CiVCPO in order to have a better overview of its potential in organic synthesis. We have also performed the first immobilisation study of this enzyme on 3 types of supports: 3 EziG™ glass beads coated with different polymers, 5 Relizyme™ polymethacrylate beads with different functional groups, the commercial Amberlite IRA900 and Dowex 50WX8, and 3 metal-organic frameworks from the UiO-66(Zr) family. As a result, we could retain 50% of total immobilized activity on 2 Relizyme supports (ethylamine (EA403) &amp; iminodiacetic (IDA403), with 55% activity kept over 5 recycling steps. The unconventional UiO-66(Zr) family also proved to be an interesting material for this enzyme. Finally, we show that free enzyme and supported enzyme are suitable for bromination and chlorination of a range of phenolic compounds with excellent yields with up to 65% conversion in 24 h in the tested conditions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jcmpt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Nanotechnology] Nanostructured niobium-doped nickel-rich multiphase positive electrode active material for high-power lithium-based batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Nanotechnology, Published online: 23 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41565-025-02092-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A two-step doping strategy for preparing Nb-doped Ni-rich positive electrode active materials forms nanosized grains and enables reversible multiphase transitions, improving lithium-ion transport and high-power performance of Li-based batteries.</description><author>Nature Nanotechnology</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Study of anion transport by amide-based macrocycles of different sizes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g4gds?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Synthetic anion receptors can transport anions across lipid bilayer membranes. Many anion transporters have been reported, including macrocyclic compounds. However, there are no systematic studies on how the size of macrocycles impacts their anion transport activity and selectivity. Therefore, we prepared eight amide-based macrocyclic compounds with ring sizes ranging from 18 to 26 atoms, as well as four bis-amides. We studied these compounds as anion receptors using chloride titrations and molecular modelling, and as anion transporters using liposomes with various fluorescent probes. Neither the size of the macrocycles nor the affinity for chloride were found to be determining factors for chloride transport activity; preorganisation appears to play a more important role. Fluorination was found to have a clear positive effect on anion transport rates, with the bis-amides performing surprisingly well compared to the macrocycles. The smallest non-fluorinated macrocycle exhibited selectivity for chloride over hydroxide and nitrate, whereas the pentafluorophenyl bis-amide demonstrated effective transport of bicarbonate and nitrate, likely due to anion-pi interactions in addition to hydrogen bonding. The insights from this study will shape the design of future anionophores.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g4gds?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ion-Conductive Vitrimers Based on Backbone-Type Triazolium Poly(ionic liquid)s: Counterion-Dependent Dynamics and Backbone Flexibility</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2mmg1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>To simultaneously achieve high ionic conductivity and recyclability, vitrimers were prepared using backbone-type triazolium poly(ionic liquid)s (TPILs) that integrate ionic transport with dynamic network rearrangement via trans-N-alkylation. TPIL elastomers bearing I⁻, BF₄⁻, PF₆⁻, and TFSI⁻ counteranions were synthesized from “clickable” ionic liquid monomers, and their glass transition temperature (Tg), ionic conductivity, and vitrimeric dynamics were compared. Only the I⁻-based network exhibited stress relaxation at 170 °C, indicating that nucleophilic anions are important for bond exchange. However, a trade-off was observed between ionic transport and dynamic network rearrangement. Furthermore, mixed-anion TPIL elastomers using I⁻+TFSI⁻ exhibited lower Tg and higher ionic conductivity than I⁻-based elastomer, while still maintaining vitrimer-like relaxation. The segmental relaxation was decoupled from Arrhenius-type bond-exchange dynamics. Ionic conduction was dominated by segmental motion, with minimal contribution from cross-link exchange. This design combining flexible polymer backbones and cooperative anion engineering can create recyclable, highly conductive polymer electrolytes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2mmg1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Advances in Calcium Isotope Purification and Analysis Using Cutting-Edge Signal Amplifiers for Matrix-Diverse Reference Materials</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ddk2z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Stable calcium (Ca) isotopes are increasingly applied across geosciences, medical sciences, ecology, paleontology, and archaeology. However, the deployment speed of Ca isotope applications worldwide is hampered by three major challenges: 1) the necessity for complex Ca purification procedures prior to analysis; 2) expensive instrumentation (typically TIMS or ICP-MS) requiring specific configurations and fine-tuning to generate reliable data; and 3) the exhaustion of some of the most widely used reference materials for cross-laboratory comparisons. In this study we present methodological advances aimed at lifting some of these barriers. First, we refined existing chromatography methods for purifying Ca by developing a branching procedure based on commercially available labware to allow faster method transfer and to minimize resin and reagent consumption for a variety of sample matrices. Our adjustments drastically improved strontium (Sr) separation from Ca, including for Sr-rich samples such as seawater. Second, we explored the potential of 10¹³Ω Faraday cup amplifiers for improving Ca isotope measurements. Our results show improved precision in 43Ca measurements under low ionic transmission configurations with δ43/42Ca standard deviation value reduced by half. This expands the list of ICP-MS configurations capable of producing reliable Ca isotope measurements and delineates a path for less sample-destructive methods (i.e., lower Ca analytical requirements). These amplifiers also markedly enhanced the correction of Sr²⁺ interferences typically affecting Ca ion beams. In this configuration, accurate and precise Ca isotopic measurements were obtained without prior Sr removal for Sr/Ca concentration ratios up to 10⁻². Lastly, using these technical advancements we analyzed existing and new international certified reference materials (SRM1486, SRM1400, IAPSO, CACB-1, DOLT-5, DORM-5, TORT-3), complementing existing and out-of-stock standards of the Ca isotope toolbox, notably for Ca carbonate and marine soft tissues. Together, these advances open the door of Ca isotope research to more laboratories and pave the way for future developments and applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ddk2z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Predicting Sequence Dependent Fluorescence with Classic Machine Learning Models</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs62c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Terminally labeled DNA oligonucleotides have wide applications in modern biology and biotechnological applications. It has been observed that the fluorescent intensity of light released from these fluorescent labels is heavily influenced by the terminal sequence of nucleotides. Recent studies have assayed and published the raw fluorescent values of  Cy3 and Cy5 as a function of the most adjacent 5 nucleotides resulting in 1024 data points. While experimentally tractable, an increase in the sequence space will vastly increase the experimental and time cost. Machine Learning is well suited to addressing the issue of experimental tractability however there is a wide design space in the choice of algorithms. In this work we use classic machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptrons and Random Forests to both predict the raw intensity value and classify the intensity magnitude of the fluorophore using the sequence as input. We demonstrate that the performance of these models is heavily dependent on the numerical transformation of the sequence and that Random Forest consistently outperforms all other models in both regression and classification tasks irrespective of the sequence transformation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs62c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine learning driven advances in molecular dynamics of bulk and interfacial aqueous systems</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6vdl2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely applied to investigate various physical and chemical processes in aqueous and interfacial environments, which are crucial for the design of energy materials and for understanding several chemical processes at the heart of life itself. However, the applicability of MD simulations has been constrained by several inherent challenges, including the accuracy of force fields, limitations in simulation size and timescales. One promising solution to these challenges is the integration of machine learning (ML) methods, both for improved description of the nature of interactions in aqueous systems as well as for enhanced sampling. In this review, we discuss the principles, implementation, and applications of ML force fields (MLFFs) and ML enhanced sampling methods to the study of aqueous, interfacial systems. We discuss five key categories of applications that use MLFFs, ML-enhanced sampling, and ML-driven data analytics. We first discuss how MLFFs are enabling quantum level accuracy at classical level cost for large scale simulations of complex aqueous and interfacial systems, and then highlight how coupling them with enhanced sampling and advanced data analytics, especially graph based approaches for featurizing such systems, can be used both for enhancing simulations and for understanding them by yielding reliable low dimensional reaction coordinates that improve the interpretation of high dimensional MD data. The discussed applications include investigations into the structure and dynamics of bulk water and aqueous interfaces, proton transfer, catalysis, phase transitions, and the prediction of vibrational spectra. In each case, we highlight how ML-based methods enable simulations that were previously computationally prohibitive and provide new physical insights into aqueous solutions and interfaces. For instance, MLFFs allow nanosecond-scale simulations with thousands of atoms while maintaining quantum chemistry accuracy. Additionally, ML-enhanced sampling facilitates the crossing of large reaction barriers and enables the exploration of extensive configuration spaces. Moreover, ML models trained on simulation data uncover previously overlooked factors, such as the role of solvent dynamics in phase transitions. The combination of MLFFs with enhanced sampling techniques makes the calculation of high-dimensional free energy surfaces feasible, significantly improving our understanding of chemical reactions. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in this field and outline potential future research directions to further advance the integration of ML in MD simulations.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6vdl2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

We systematically investi- gate data selection strategies to optimize the Chebyshev Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES) po- tential for the Bi-Pt nanoclusters by comparing three innovative sampling methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)/k-means (structural diversity), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)/k-means (force-space di- versity), and hierarchical clustering. Quantitatively, the PCA/k-means strategy proved most effective for global ac- curacy, yielding the lowest force errors and achieving energy root mean square errors (RMSE) values competitive with DFT, demonstrating excellent accuracy (19.16 meV/atom). Structural validation on 34 unique DFT-optimized isomers further confirmed the potential’s high fidelity, with the best model PCA/k-means reproducing structures with an average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.10 Å. However, the t-SNE methods, by maximizing diversity in the force space, demonstrated superior extrapolative power, leading to the more precise prediction of a novel stel- lated octadecagon Bi18Pt24 cage structure, demonstrating the potential for exploring previously unseen morphologies.

The new module enables Born-Oppenheimer (single-surface) dynamics using configuration-interaction singles and random phase approximation for excited-states, allowing long trajectories and large statistical ensembles to be simulated efficiently on a single GPU. We also implement an extended-Lagrangian ESMD (XL-ESMD) scheme that propagates auxiliary electronic variables, enabling relaxed ground and excited-state convergence thresholds without compromising energy conservation. The ESMD implementation scales smoothly from small chromophores to a nearly 900-atom dendrimer (taking 6.5 s per ESMD step). PYSEQM also supports batched execution, allowing many geometries or trajectories to be evaluated in a single GPU launch, substantially increasing throughput and making ensemble-based protocols routine. As a demonstration, we compute absorption, emission, and infrared spectra from trajectories propagated on the ground and first excited states, illustrating practical utility of PYSEQM. The XL-ESMD scheme yields identical spectra at significantly lower computational cost, establishing the role of extended Lagrangian based dynamics for efficient ESMD simulations. Beyond raw performance, PYSEQM’s Pytorch foundation provides  automatic differentiation for forces, efficient GPU batching, and seamless interfacing with machine learning models. These capabilities position PYSEQM as practical platform for machine learning-augmented excited-state dynamics and lay the foundation for future data-driven nonadiabatic ESMD modeling of ultrafast spectroscopic probes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6h565?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Mixed ionic–electronic conductor based on B 16  framework</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251904/3375535/Mixed-ionic-electronic-conductor-based-on-B16</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) are essential materials for next-generation energy storage and conversion systems.

The framework shows good structural stability: the volume change after ion insertion is less than 12.4%, and its mechanical properties (for example, a shear modulus of 47.8 GPa) are comparable to those of traditional electrode materials like LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NCM. Through defect engineering, LiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with 12.5% crystal defects can lower the superionic transition temperature to 400 K while maintaining a high ionic conductivity of 1.65 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm. This study offers a viable approach to designing MIEC materials and demonstrates significant potential for applications such as high-temperature solid-state batteries and electrochemical sensors.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251904/3375535/Mixed-ionic-electronic-conductor-based-on-B16</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A Multicenter Multimodel Habitat Radiomics Model for Predicting Immunotherapy Response in Advanced NSCLC</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02783-X?rss=yes</link><description>Robust predictive biomarker is critical for identifying NSCLC patients who may benefit from immunotherapy.

However, the high intrinsic carrier concentration of the InGaAs NW and the ionization scattering caused by surface defect states result in a high dark current, which degrades the photodetection performance. Here, we prepared an InGaAs NW field-effect transistor modulated by ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE), where the non-volatile ultra-high electrostatic field from polarization of the P(VDF-TrFE) film modulates the carrier distribution and energy band structure inside the NW. When the P(VDF-TrFE) film is in a negative polarization state, the electrostatic field depletes the carriers in the NW channel, remarkably suppressing the dark current by over two orders of magnitude. Consequently, our single InGaAs NW photodetector achieves both remarkable responsivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;) of 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and specific detectivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;D*&lt;/span&gt;) of 7.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at the optical communication wavelength, significantly exceeding the commercial InGaAs and the nanowire-based photodetector. Moreover, the suppressed dark current enhances the polarization-sensitive detection capability, increasing the polarization ratio from 1.3 to 3.6. This enables the application of our device to polarization-sensitive infrared imaging. Our work demonstrates the value of ferroelectric polymer modulation for low-dimensional, high-performance infrared photodetectors.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/253505/3375553/Ferroelectric-gated-highly-sensitive-InGaAs</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Uncovering enhanced ferroelectricity: Substituent-driven design of wurtzite ZnO materials</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252104/3375551/Uncovering-enhanced-ferroelectricity-Substituent</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Ferroelectricity has been observed in wurtzite ZnO (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;-ZnO), and ionic substitution has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the ferroelectricity and spontaneous polarization.

A key limitation to its practical application is its moderate polarization strength. This study reports the polarization evolution of CIPS across a wide range of temperatures and pressures and elucidates the mechanisms underlying polarization enhancement under various conditions. The polarization enhancement observed under high-pressure-high-temperature conditions is attributed to the increased occupancy of Cu ions at out-of-plane (Cu&lt;sup&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt;) sites, which correspond to high-polarization configurations. In contrast, the high-pressure-low-temperature polarization improvement stems from enhanced ordering of Cu ions. Furthermore, a phase diagram of CIPS over a wide range of temperatures and pressures was established based on Raman spectroscopy and ferroelectric polarization measurements. This diagram further illustrates dipole ordering and Cu-ion freezing in the low-temperature &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Cc&lt;/span&gt; phase.

Here, we establish a structure--dynamics--property relationship for two COFs by combining three-dimensional electron diffraction, low-frequency vibrational spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Using 3D electron diffraction, we determine, for the first time, the crystal structure of the closed-pore reduced framework COF-300-AR, revealing a bent linker conformation. Terahertz and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, together with solid-state DFT and local mode analysis, are then used to resolve the low-frequency lattice dynamics of COF-300 and closed-pore COF-300-AR and to quantify linker flexibility in terms of imine/amine torsions. Normal mode decomposition and torsional potential energy surfaces show that these torsions are roughly twice as stiff in \h\ as in \AR, and that the reduced framework has a shallower, multi-well torsional potential energy landscape, which permits the observed closed-pore structure. In \h, the same torsional coordinate is much stiffer, locking the structure into a porous framework. More broadly, this work demonstrates how combining advanced structure determination with low-frequency vibrational spectroscopy and first-principles calculations can identify, and subsequently tune, the coordinates that control pore opening, guest uptake, and structural integrity in flexible COFs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1kkhm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] An Interpretative Charge-Transfer Framework for Molecules Adsorbed on Graphene Inspired by the van Arkel–Ketelaar Diagram</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7wx80?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>An interpretive graphical framework is presented for rationalizing charge-transfer phenomena at molecule–graphene interfaces. Inspired by the classical van Arkel–Ketelaar diagram, the model unifies n- and p-doping pathways within a single representation by explicitly distinguishing between integer charge transfer (ICT) and partial charge transfer (PCT). By mapping the mean frontier-orbital energy and the molecular energy gap onto a triangular coordinate space, the framework provides a compact visualization of the energetic conditions that govern charge transfer, conditions typically dispersed across multiple band–orbital diagrams constructed separately for each adsorbate–adsorbent pair. This single-diagram approach enables the qualitative interpretation of a virtually limitless number of energetic scenarios, initially considering ideal physicochemical conditions. It is further shown that the graphical topology is preserved under non-ideal interface effects, including vacuum-level offsets, interfacial dipoles, structural defects, and finite temperature, which highlights the robustness and broad applicability of the model. Beyond its conceptual value, the framework fulfills a didactic role by offering an intuitive tool for teaching and learning topics related to solid-state chemistry, surface chemistry, interfacial phenomena, doping mechanisms, adsorption, and interfacial charge transfer.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

However, most techniques measure quantities dependent on multiple biophysical properties rather than individual ones, limiting their biological/clinical relevance. Here, we present a single-cell biophysical phenotyping technique that quantifies size (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dc&lt;/span&gt;) and elastic modulus (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;) of cells deforming at different levels along constriction microchannels.

The measurement employs lock-in amplification-assisted electrokinetic sensing via embedded electrodes across three channel sections with varying constriction widths, inducing distinct cell deformations. We demonstrate the technique by profiling normal and cancerous breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231), as well as drug-treated cancer cells (cytochalasin D, cetuximab, and lysophosphatidic acid). The biophysical phenotyping enables cell classification with high accuracy (&amp;gt;95.45% via principal component analysis; &amp;gt;97.32% via machine learning).

However, a significant barrier to their development is the lack of a comprehensive materials database, which hinders systematic studies and the discovery of emergent AOS materials. This study addresses this gap by constructing a dedicated database of zinc-tin-based doped oxide semiconductors (Zn–M–Sn–O) and their thin-film transistor (TFT) performance parameters, compiled from an extensive review of existing literature. Our research aims to perform a systematic analysis of the correlations between key material properties and device performance. We summarize and analyze existing Zn–M–Sn–O based optoelectronic devices, extracting key features such as material compositions, processing parameters, and performance metrics. These features are then used to construct feature vectors. By applying a machine learning algorithm to this dataset, we establish a performance prediction model for Zn–M–Sn–O TFTs. This machine learning-assisted approach allows us to efficiently screen materials and predict the optimal M element for high-performance devices. This methodology significantly accelerates the discovery and development of advanced AOS materials, paving the way for next-generation optoelectronic technologies.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Open Issues</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251903/3375349/Machine-learning-assisted-performance-prediction</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Thermal conductivity limits of MoS 2  and MoSe 2 : Revisiting high-order anharmonic lattice dynamics with machine learning potentials</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ( κ) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs), including recently developed foundation models. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and HIPHIVE against density functional theory and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on  κ. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Missense mutations in cancer: in silico predictions, developing treatments, and overcoming cell resistance.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6928d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Targeted therapies built around specific genetic driver mutations have become a cornerstone of precision oncology.

Computations combined with experiments have gained increasing attention for electrolyte development. However, the inherent complexity of electrolytes poses a significant challenge. Classical molecular dynamics often fails due to inaccuracies in force field parameters, while ab initio calculationsarelimitedbyhighcomputationalcosts. Recently, machinelearning molecular dynamics has emerged as an efficient and accurate alternative. However, its application is hindered by limited transferability of machine learning potentials. In this work, we developed a universal machine learning potential for electrolytes using an iterative training approach on randomly composed datasets, enabling the accurate computation of key properties for a broad range of electrolytes via molecular dynamics. Furthermore, coordination dynamics analysis of Li ion, by quantifying the coordination lifetime, provides a direct, quantitative measure of solvation strength. The universal machine learning potential for electrolytes facilitates the prediction and optimization of electrolyte properties, offering a powerful tool for electrolyte design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fnw1w-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Large-scale structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis enables functional annotation of animal venom peptides</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gd3c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Animal venoms constitute one of the most chemically diverse and pharmacologically rich peptide repertoires in nature, yet the vast majority of venom peptides remain structurally and functionally unannotated due to limited material availability and a paucity of experimentally solved structures. This knowledge gap has significantly constrained both mechanistic understanding and translational applications of venom-derived molecules. Here we conduct a comprehensive structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis of close to 4,000 venom peptides (i.e. teretoxins and conotoxins) from marine snails using AlphaFold2. While conotoxins have been studied for over six decades, teretoxins remain largely unexplored. Our study provides the first comprehensive structural classification and functional annotation of the entire known teretoxin repertoire, substantially expanding the venom peptide landscape. Structural clustering analysis revealed that both teretoxins and conotoxins form a large number of structural clusters (225 and 307 clusters, respectively), with each cluster characterized by conserved cysteine frameworks and disulfide connectivity. Importantly, combining structural clusters with phylogenetic analysis revealed that structure prediction together with cysteine frameworks offer an improved strategy for venom peptide classification. We used predicted disulfide connectivity from derived from AlphaFold2 models to annotate the majority of uncharacterized conotoxins on ConoServer database, addressing a long-standing classification bottleneck in venom peptide classification efforts. As a concrete demonstration of functional prediction, co-clustering of predicted teretoxin and conotoxin structures led to the identification of teretoxins structurally homologous to conotoxins with described activities, suggesting shared functional activities such as Kunitz-type peptide activity, neurotoxicity, and ion channel inhibition. Using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on our Kunitz-type peptide co-cluster, we observed that conotoxin P07849 and teretoxin Tar2.9 engage trypsin in a manner similar to the Kunitz Domain 1 (KD1) of the Alzheimer’s amyloid beta-protein precursor (APPI), a previously unappreciated protease inhibitory role for this venom peptide family. Overall, this work establishes a scalable, structure-centric framework that combines structure prediction, structural clustering, co-clustering, and phylogenetics for deorphanizing venom peptides, enabling predicted annotation and functional inference for future experimental, pharmacological, and therapeutic exploration.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gd3c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Performance of dispersion models in predicting ambient hydrocarbon concentrations at a regional air quality monitor in an oil and gas producing region</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xkhh9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The performance of four widely used dispersion models (AERMOD, a single equation Gaussian formulation, and two versions of CALPUFF) for predicting ambient hydrocarbon concentrations at a regional air quality monitor in the Eagle Ford Shale oil and gas production region was assessed. Model performance is found to vary considerably based on the performance objective, meteorological conditions, and temporal resolution. Among the models evaluated in this work, the methods used to estimate the dispersion coefficients and whether the model was plume- or puff-based strongly influenced model performance. Uncertainties in meteorological and emissions inputs also played an important role in model performance, but the significance of their impact varied depending on the performance objective. Techniques to identify and address model uncertainties and for selecting the best performing model for a given application are suggested.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xkhh9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine Learning-Guided Scope Selection to Balance Performance and Substrate Similarity</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r0sst?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The determination of a reaction substrate scope enables downstream users to decide whether the reaction in question is suitable for their envisioned application. The information content of the scope, as demonstrated by its performance and diversity, is crucial to inform the quality of this decision. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and easy to use machine learning algorithm, ScopeBO, for the selection of scopes that balance these two aspects. We use the Vendi score as a metric for scope diversity and establish a scope score that quantifies scope performance within the context of a specific chemical search space. The hyperparameters of ScopeBO are optimized using these metrics, and its performance is validated with several reaction datasets, demonstrating favorable performance against that of alternative selection methods. Through this quantitative optimization, ScopeBO provides an approach towards objective and standardized scope selection that maximizes the information content of the evaluated substrates.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r0sst?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Relationship Between Local Disorder and Atomic Motion in an Antiperovskite Solid Electrolyte</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dxdtz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Solid-state electrolytes are an alternative to conventional liquid systems for safer and more efficient batteries, whereas a shift from Li to Na would unlock systems with increased resource availability and simplified supply chains. Antiperovskite Na2[NH2][BH4] recently emerged as a candidate that showcases that internal polyanion dynamics can facilitate Na transport. However, experimental validation of the predicted mechanisms of atomic motion remains scarce. To this end, we investigate the intricate relationship between local atomic disorder and dynamic motion. Maps of atomic disorder from total scattering data reproduce the predictions of polyanion rotation and Na translation by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The comparison also reveals the concurrence of BD4- translations, which were overlooked in previous analyses, and the existence of static disorder due to the different degrees of freedom of each anion, even while maintaining their ideal shape. This complex interplay refines mechanisms governing ion dynamics that determine solid-state electrolyte functionality. Realistic design strategies for rotor-based electrolytes must explicitly account for polyanion translation and static disorder, rather than optimizing rotational freedom in isolation. The combination of total scattering experiments with AIMD provides a route to screen potential polyanion-based candidates for favorable multi-modal disorder, thus steering the discovery of new phases with transformational ionic conductivity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dxdtz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Multi-Objective Catalyst Discovery in High-Entropy Alloy Composition Space: The Role of Noble Metals on the Pareto Front for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cq92m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Discovering new materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions is a key step toward energy sustainability. However, for catalysts to be viable in practice, they must perform in multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. We demonstrate this challenge for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where activity, stability, and material cost must be balanced. Using the continuous composition space of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) together with our established models for activity and dissolution, we identify a Pareto-optimal set of ORR catalysts within the Ag–Au–Cu–Ir–Pd–Pt–Rh–Ru system via multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we introduce a fine-tuned machine learning model that predicts adsorption energies for alloys spanning 12 elements and 9 adsorbates.  Our results show that alloying expands the hypervolume spanned by the Pareto front, consisting of low- to medium-entropy alloys composed primarily of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, and Pt. We further propose an approach for analyzing the Pareto front by quantifying the loss in hypervolume when critical elements (Au, Pd, and Pt) are removed, clarifying their relative contributions to optimal performance.  This work highlights the need to consider all relevant objectives in catalyst optimization and the advantage of HEAs as a powerful platform for multi-objective catalyst discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cq92m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Agent-based framework for modeling hyperlocal urban air quality</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-v1lhr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Urban air quality exhibits significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity at hyperlocal scales, necessitating advanced modeling paradigms that can bridge the gap between computationally intensive physics-based models and empirically-driven statistical approaches. This paper introduces a novel agent-based modeling framework specifically designed for hyperlocal air quality assessment, capable of providing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. The proposed framework discretizes urban environments into interacting agents, with pollutant dynamics governed by a parameterized mass balance that preserves fundamental physics while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is demonstrated through a case study in Chennai, India, using mobile monitoring data across a 25 km route with 250 m spatial resolution. Geospatial features (traffic, land use, meteorology) are encoded as agent properties through physically interpretable parameters. This enables transparent attribution of pollution sources and transport pathways, thereby strengthening the framework’s descriptive capabilities. The approach successfully captures complex spatio-temporal pollution dynamics and describes pollution hotspots by attributing them to source and transport influences. Predictive capabilities are demonstrated through spatio-temporal interpolation and temporal forecasting. Spatio-temporal formulation of the framework enables it to outperform regular unidimensional methods. The discrete agent structure facilitates prescriptive applications, demonstrated here through identification of least-exposure routes between locations. The unification of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive capabilities within a single interpretable framework makes it a potentially valuable tool for urban environmental management and real-time decision support systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-v1lhr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Widely Targeted Metabolomics and Machine Learning Identify Succinate as a Key Metabolite in Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02781-6?rss=yes</link><description>Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment.

Conventional skyrmion-based racetracks employ binary encoding through inter-skyrmion spacing in one-dimensional nanostrips, yet maintaining precise spacing remains challenging due to thermal fluctuations, noise, and material defects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-lane racetrack architecture separated by an engineered domain wall. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that this design offers several critical advantages: (1) Topological repulsion from the domain wall effectively confines skyrmions to their respective lanes, eliminating cross-lane migration. (2) The motion dynamics of skyrmions in one lane exhibit minimal interference from those in the adjacent lane, owing to the topological repulsion from the domain wall that ensures a sufficiently large inter-lane spacing to weaken dipole interactions. (3) The structure enables programmable operations, including skyrmion sorting, directional transport, and controlled annihilation.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252404/3375468/Domain-wall-isolated-dual-lane-racetrack-for</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Healing the buried interface with versatile glutamic acid for efficient and stable SnO 2 -based perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/253901/3375359/Healing-the-buried-interface-with-versatile</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Effectively suppressing defects at the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite (PVK) interface is critical for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we introduce glutamic acid (Glu) into SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving synergistic regulation of the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PVK interface properties. The introduction of Glu not only significantly suppresses SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; agglomeration but also, due to the presence of the dual carbonyl group in the molecule, effectively coordinates with Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, passivating the defects on both SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PVK layers. Correspondingly, the density functional theory calculation results indicate that when the amino group in Glu coordinates with Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, the coordination interaction between the terminal carbonyl group (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=O) and Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; is further enhanced. Therefore, the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Glu-based PSC achieves a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.35% (0.06 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 18.50% in the mini-module (15 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The unencapsulated device maintains &amp;gt;92% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000 h under air. This study reveals the mechanism by which Glu synergistically regulates the multi-interface property, thus providing an effective approach for achieving efficient SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based PSCs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/253901/3375359/Healing-the-buried-interface-with-versatile</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Current-induced generation and long-distance motion of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnetic materials</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252401/3375358/Current-induced-generation-and-long-distance</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Magnetic skyrmions, topologically protected spin textures, exhibit unique quasiparticle characteristics, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices. Specifically, synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions, stabilized via interlayer exchange coupling in multilayer systems, achieve ultra-high motion speeds while eliminating the detrimental skyrmion Hall effect through topological charge compensation. Despite significant advancements in generating and manipulating SAF skyrmions, the controlled creation of individual skyrmions at predetermined locations and their reliable long-range transport remain challenging. In this study, we explore both the generation and motion dynamics of SAF skyrmions in Ta/[Pt/Co]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ru/[Co/Pt]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ta multilayer strips by current pulse excitation. By precisely controlling the amplitude and duration of the current pulses, as well as the external magnetic field strength, we generate skyrmions at defect sites and drive their depinning. Our results demonstrate that SAF skyrmions move along the strip with a Hall angle of 0.2°–0.9°. More importantly, under an optimal external magnetic field, SAF skyrmions can travel long distances—up to the full length of the strip. Furthermore, reversing the driving current causes the SAF skyrmion to reverse its motion direction, allowing for controllable, repeated bidirectional movement along the strip. These findings represent a significant step forward in the development of spintronic devices based on the controlled generation and long-range transport of SAF skyrmions.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252401/3375358/Current-induced-generation-and-long-distance</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Dislocations influence the background hole densities in Ge/Si virtual substrates</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251901/3375356/Dislocations-influence-the-background-hole</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;In this study, the interaction between extended defects and the electrical activity of Ge/Si (001) plastically relaxed epitaxial layers is examined. We used depth-resolved electrochemical capacitance–voltage profiling to measure the background active carrier concentration in a set of epilayers featuring a threading dislocation density spanning more than four orders of magnitude (from 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). The depth profile of the carrier concentration shows a pronounced peak, which is attributed to the presence of misfit dislocations at the Ge/Si heterointerface; and a nearly constant p-type background extending throughout the Ge layer. This background level decreases with increased crystalline quality, and saturates at ∼1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; when the dislocation density falls below ∼1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating a lower limit governed by electrically active defect states and impurity-related point defect complexes formed during epitaxial growth and thermal processing. These findings suggest that extended and point defects critically influence the unintentional doping observed in Ge on Si epitaxy. Understanding their interplay provides valuable insights into defect engineering strategies that can suppress electrically active defects, enabling the fabrication of high-performance Ge-based electronic and photonic devices with improved doping control and more predictable electrical behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251901/3375356/Dislocations-influence-the-background-hole</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Robust local dipole and weak inter-dipole coupling in two-dimensional ferroelectric CuInP 2 S 6  monolayers</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252901/3375352/Robust-local-dipole-and-weak-inter-dipole-coupling</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;In this work, we uncover the physical origin of room-temperature stable and small-sized ferroelectric domains in monolayer CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Our phenomenological model, accurately fitted by first-principles datasets, elucidates the physical origins of previously reported order–disorder transitions and scale-free behavior in the studied system. Unlike conventional perovskite ferroelectrics, the ferroelectricity in monolayer CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; stems from spontaneous intra-cell polar distortions with negligible inter-dipole coupling. While antiferroelectric ordering emerges as the ground state, its thermal stability competes with scale-free and distorted ferroelectric configurations. We quantitatively clarify this mechanism through our modeling, demonstrating how the degeneracy of metastable states enables coexisting order parameters across multiple length scales. This work fundamentally distinguishes weak-correlation ferroelectricity from conventional cooperative mechanisms, offering promising design principles for nanoscale ferroelectric devices, with particular promise for high-density memory applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252901/3375352/Robust-local-dipole-and-weak-inter-dipole-coupling</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Failure of Hund’s J in Contemporary DFT+U+J: Insights from Spin-Crossover Fe(II) Complexes</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291/asset/images/medium/ct5c01291_0011.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Feature-Selective Preprocessing with Electrically Robust Boron Nitride-Based Dynamic Memristors for Reliable Lightweight Neural Networks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967/asset/images/medium/nn5c16967_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c16967&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:05:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Interpreting X-ray Diffraction Patterns of Metal–Organic Frameworks via Generative Artificial Intelligence</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c16416/asset/images/medium/ja5c16416_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c16416&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:03:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Free-energy perturbation in the exchange-correlation space accelerated by machine learning: application to silica polymorphs</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01874-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 20 December 2025;

Baglioni et al. show that X-ray irradiation increases the enthalpy of chalcogenide glasses, amplifying the secondary Johari-Goldstein relaxation and reflecting enhanced defect-induced heterogeneity. These results establish X-ray irradiation as a precise tool to control structural heterogeneity and mechanical behavior, providing a versatile approach to designing glasses with tunable relaxation

The bipolar photodetectors with polarity-switchable photoresponse take advantage of multi-dimensional signal recognition and signal processing efficiency. However, as-reported bipolar photodetectors are limited primarily to complex multi-layer heterojunction architectures based on either multi-wavelength absorption or a competitive photoresponse mechanism. The lack of a regulation scheme for implementing and optimizing polarity-switchable photoresponse of simple-structured GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based photodetectors becomes a bottleneck for friendly integration and efficient signal recognition. Herein, introducing a ferroelectric component endows amorphous GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/HZO) heterojunction photodetectors with programmable self-powered characteristics. The self-powered solar-blind photodetector (SSBPD) exhibits boosted polarity-switchable photoresponse by the coupling of ferro-pyro-phototronic effect. A switchover between positive to negative photoresponse is enabled by switching polarization from the upward state to the downward state. Photo-induced pyroelectric effect boosts bipolar photoresponse of the SSBPD characterized by four-stage photocurrent dynamic behavior. Under superposition contributions of programmable ferroelectric polarization and pyroelectric effect, the photoresponse enhancement factor of the SSBPD is 341% (226%) under upward (downward)-polarization state. Correspondingly, the maximum responsivity and detectivity are up to 0.26 mA/W and 4.47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, respectively. The SSBPD maintains excellent durability over a wide temperature range. Based on programmable bipolar photoresponse, a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/HZO photoelectric device displays application prospects in simulating a self-adaptive neuromorphic vision system and a nighttime anti-collision monitoring system. This work proposes a strategy to develop simple-architecture GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based bipolar photodetectors by multiple-effect coupling.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041422/3375099/Enabling-bipolar-photoresponse-improvement-of-a</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Here, we investigate croconic acid, a hydrogen-bonded organic ferroelectric, using real-time time-dependent density functional theory to uncover the microscopic mechanisms of light-induced structural transitions and nonlinear optical responses. High-order harmonic generation in croconic acid is found to be highly sensitive to proton displacement within hydrogen bonds, with polarization switching reshaping internal electronic asymmetry and modulating intersite electron currents. Subangstrom-scale lattice distortions induce marked enhancements or suppressions in the harmonics, highlighting the extreme sensitivity of the nonlinear response to hydrogen-bond configuration. These results reveal a light-driven electron–proton–lattice interaction mechanism in organic ferroelectrics, providing a route toward tunable ultrafast photonic and optoelectronic devices based on molecular materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/241102/3374918/Ultrafast-laser-induced-anharmonic-lattice</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Spin-splitting-torque-driven field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in RuO 2 /synthetic antiferromagnet heterostructures for spintronic convolutional neural networks</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/242405/3374916/Spin-splitting-torque-driven-field-free</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;With the growing demand for low-power and high-speed spintronic devices, the development of advanced material systems with efficient spin control capabilities has emerged as a central focus in spintronics research.

This study investigates the factors that make some odors more evocative than others. We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes. Using machine learning with SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identified distinct predictors for each process.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02728-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Integrative Analysis of Transcriptomic Data Reveals a Predictive Gene Signature for Chemoradiotherapy Response in Rectal Cancer</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02716-6?rss=yes</link><description>Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), but only a minority of patients achieve a pathological complete response (pCR). Predictive biomarkers of response could help guide treatment decisions, yet none have reached clinical practice. In this exploratory study, we integrated six publicly available transcriptomic datasets and applied machine learning to derive a 186-gene signature predictive of nCRT response. The signature showed good performance in cross-validation (AUC 0.80) and was associated with consensus molecular (CMS4) and immune (iCMS3) subtypes enriched in responders.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02716-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Combining DNA Methylation Features and Clinical Characteristics Predicts Ketamine Treatment Response for PTSD</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02706-3?rss=yes</link><description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits extensive clinical and biological variability, making treatment challenging.

This study introduces a solvation regulation strategy that confines perovskite crystallization within localized solvent clusters during spray deposition. Such confined growth lowers the energy barrier for crystal formation, enabling uniform, defect-suppressed films even under high humidity. The approach allows for scalable fabrication of efficient perovskite optoelectronic devices with tunable thickness on arbitrary curved surfaces.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00409-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Anharmonic Coupling in a Strong Intramolecular H-Bond System: Contributions to Static and Time-Resolved Vibrational Spectra</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487/asset/images/medium/jz5c03487_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:03:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Rhodium-Catalyzed Atroposelective Alkyne Oxyamidation Using Non-Nitrene NH Acyloxyamide Reagents</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18495</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18495/asset/images/medium/ja5c18495_0010.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18495&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18495</guid></item><item><title>[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Physical Sciences] CHARGE-MAP: An integrated framework to study the multicriteria EV charging infrastructure expansion problem</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2514184122?af=R</link><description>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 51, December 2025. &lt;br /&gt;SignificanceThe surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption has presented us the challenge of developing accessible and cost-effective charging infrastructures.

Two-dimensional M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MXenes are promising anode candidates due to their structural flexibility and low molar mass, yet their stability and storage mechanism remain unclear.

The storage mechanism involves covalent bonding between surface N and halide-ions, where adsorption strength is governed by the energy difference between occupied &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and unoccupied &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;π&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals and their electron overlap.

We propose a thermo-mechanical coupling framework for nanosecond laser ablation based on energy conservation, which is embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to enable simultaneous inversion of multiple mechanical properties. A thermo-mechanical coupling coefficient is defined to uniformly describe the dynamic allocation of input laser energy among thermal diffusion, mechanical work, and plasma shielding across different deformation stages under laser irradiation. Furthermore, hard-to-measure physical characteristics in the coupled equation are replaced with experimentally accessible features obtained through the simultaneous acquisition of spectroscopic, shockwave, and surface-wave signals. Using 210 experimental datasets, the framework simultaneously recovers Young's modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and micro-Vickers hardness with high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9927, 0.9912, 0.9916, and 0.9959, respectively), significantly outperforming the baseline method (ultrasonic velocity regression for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0012). Comparisons with linear normalization and unconstrained neural networks demonstrate that PINN achieves near-unity accuracy through the embedding of conservation-law constraints. Partial dependency analysis further uncovers the nonlinear coupling laws between input features and mechanical properties. The proposed paradigm, integrating conservation laws, measurable features, and physics-informed learning, offers a universal approach for non-contact, high-precision, and physically consistent multi-to-multi inversion of multiple material properties under nanosecond laser ablation conditions.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/244101/3374784/Measurement-of-multiple-mechanical-properties-from</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Deep learning based SEM image analysis for predicting ionic conductivity in LiZr2(PO4)3-based solid electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00232J" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00232J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kento Murakami, Yudai Yamaguchi, Yo Kato, Kazuki Ishikawa, Naoto Tanibata, Hayami Takeda, Masanobu Nakayama, Masayuki Karasuyama&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-ion-conductive oxide materials have attracted considerable attention as solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Hierarchical Attention Graph Learning with LLMs Enhancement for Molecular Solubility Prediction</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00407A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00407A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yangxin Fan, Yinghui  Wu, Roger French, Danny Perez, Michael Taylor, Ping Yang&lt;br /&gt;Solubility quantifies the concentration of a molecule that can dissolve in a given solvent.

Historically, manual inspections have been plagued by subjectivity, inefficiency, and restricted scalability, necessitating the development of enhanced detection algorithms. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing image processing and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and practical applicability. This strategy promotes classification stability by integrating machine learning classifiers, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, with fusion techniques such as Majority Voting and Mean Fusion. The experiments utilize Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for model evaluation to address dataset variability and deliver thorough assessments. The study’s results indicate that the suggested system surpasses existing systems in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, attaining an overall accuracy of 98.17%. The method is effective across various noise and resolution parameters, allowing for scalability in precision agriculture applications. This discovery not only enhances the diagnosis of plant nutrient deficiencies but also enables further investigations into real-time plant health monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046111/3374702/Smart-detection-of-plant-nutrient-deficiencies</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Machine Intelligence] LLM use in scholarly writing poses a provenance problem</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01159-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Machine Intelligence, Published online: 12 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01159-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42256-025-01159-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;LLM use in scholarly writing poses a provenance problem</description><author>Nature Machine Intelligence</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01159-8</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] PEMD: a high-throughput simulation and analysis framework for solid polymer electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00454C" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00454C, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shendong Tan, Bochun Liang, Dexin Lu, Chaoyuan Ji, Wenke Ji, Zihui Li, Tingzheng Hou&lt;br /&gt;PEMD is an open-source Python framework that integrates polymer construction, force-field parameterization, multiscale simulation, and property analysis, with standardized workflows for screening and data-driven design of solid polymer electrolytes.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Investigating CO adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) surfaces using machine learning exchange-correlation functionals</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</link><description>The ‘CO adsorption puzzle’, a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations in density functional theory to replicate CO’s experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn–Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06, and can be applied to study unseen adsorbate coverages. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Contextualized biomedical language processing enhances ICU survival prediction</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02703-8?rss=yes</link><description>Accurate prediction of intensive care unit (ICU) survival remains challenging due to heterogeneous clinical data. This study shows that contextualized biomedical language processing markedly enhances ICU survival prediction. Multimodal models integrating structured laboratory data with unstructured text (chief complaints and ICD entries) were trained and validated using MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-III, and eICU datasets.

To address this need, we integrated one in-house RNA-seq cohort with eight public datasets comprising 696 samples, together with proteomic profiling, qRT-PCR, single-cell sequencing, and FYCO1 silencing experiments. From 1,258 curated cell death–related genes, candidates were filtered by logistic regression across cohorts, and ten machine learning algorithms were combined into 105 model configurations to derive a

This review examines the underlying mechanisms that facilitate these structural changes, the various types of stimuli capable of inducing them, and the wide-ranging applications that capitalize on these dynamic properties. The discussion elucidates that the flexibility inherent in MOFs derives from several factors, including the characteristics of the metal cluster, the coordination geometry, the rigidity or flexibility of the organic linkers, and the overall topology of the framework. It is emphasized that minor alterations in these molecular-level attributes can result in significant variations in the structural behavior of MOFs, encompassing phenomena such as breathing, gate opening, and both negative and positive thermal expansion. Moreover, the review explores the experimental and computational methodologies employed to investigate MOF flexibility, incorporating &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; characterization techniques and molecular modeling approaches. It highlights how the interplay between framework design, guest interactions, and defect engineering can be strategically utilized to develop stimuli-responsive MOFs with customized functionalities suitable for applications in areas such as gas separation, gas storage, and sensing. In conclusion, the review underscores the importance of comprehending and manipulating structural transformations in MOFs, a consideration that has emerged as a key element in contemporary materials science and engineering.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/120601/3374651/Structural-transformations-in-metal-organic</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A Physics Informed Model for the Prediction of Surface Energies and the Shape of Metal Particles</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02691-4?rss=yes</link><description>Surface energies of metal-based systems are important for determining the Wulff-constructed shapes of metal nanoparticles and understanding the stability. We have developed a physics informed method to predict the total energy of metal-based systems across a wide range of configurations. Our method has been tested against Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for late transition metals.

Using mouse preimplantation embryos with altered cell size and ploidy, we show that arrest primarily results from an imbalance between ploidy and cytoplasmic volume, rather than from haploidy itself.

These nanodevices exhibit near-linear long-term potentiation and long-term depression characteristics under repetitive voltage pulses, achieving a remarkable dynamic range.

They can vary in nature, geometry, and size, ranging from microscopic-size defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twin planes, and oxygen vacancies, to macroscopic-size defects such as segregations, indentations, contamination, cracks, and voids. Irrespective of their type, defects perturb the flow of electric current, forcing it to deviate from its path. In the best-case scenario, the associated perturbation can be damped within a distance of the order of the size of the defect if the rigidity of the superconducting state, characterized by the creep exponent &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;, is low. In most cases, however, this perturbation spans macroscopic distances covering the entire superconducting sample and thus dramatically influences the response of the system. In this work, we review the current state of theoretical understanding and experimental evidence on the modification of magnetic flux patterns in superconductors by border defects, including the influence of their geometry, temperature, and applied magnetic field. We scrutinize and contrast the picture emerging from a continuous media standpoint, i.e., ignoring the granularity imposed by the vortex quantization, with that provided by a phenomenological approach dictated by the vortex dynamics. In addition, we discuss the influence of border indentations on the nucleation of thermomagnetic instabilities.

The results reveal a Type II heterojunction with a favorable conduction band offset of 0.31 eV for electron injection from the ITO contact in its as-deposited state, which increased to 0.45 eV after annealing for 1 min in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 550 °C. Annealing reduced the Fermi energy separation from the conduction band edge from 1.04 to 0.6 eV and from 0.74 to 0.15 eV in the ITO and Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films, respectively. The corresponding change in the specific contact resistivity was a decrease from 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Ω cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Ω cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films revealed the presence of Ga–Ga bonding and uncoordinated oxygen, indicating the coexistence of Ga interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Although Ga interstitials are known to be shallow donors, the presence of both types of donors prevents unambiguous assignment of the intrinsic n-type conductivity. XPS also confirmed Ga diffusion into the ITO contact upon annealing, consistent with the measured decrease in the Fermi level separation from the conduction band edge and an increase in free electron concentration. The results show that forming a mixed, defective ITO/Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer is crucial for reducing contact resistance and enhancing the ohmicity of ITO contacts to β-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

MRPARCv2 introduces hierarchical discretization and cross-resolution feature communication to improve the accuracy and efficiency of flow simulations. We evaluate the model on a challenging 2D turbulent radiative layer dataset from The Well multi-physics benchmark repository and demonstrate significant improvements when compared to the single resolution baseline model, in both Variance Scaled Root Mean Squared Error and physics-driven metrics, including turbulent kinetic energy spectra and mass–temperature distributions. Despite having 30% fewer trainable parameters, MRPARCv2 outperforms its predecessor by up to 50% in roll-out prediction error and 86% in spectral error. A preliminary study on uncertainty quantification was performed, and we also analyzed the model’s performance under different levels of abstractions of the flow, specifically on sampling subsets of field variables. We find that the absence of physical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) in the network architecture leads to degraded accuracy. A variable substitution experiment confirms that this issue persists regardless of which physical quantity is predicted directly. Our findings highlight the advantages of multi-resolution inductive bias for capturing multi-scale flow dynamics and suggest the need for future PIML models to embed EOS knowledge to enhance physical fidelity.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046110/3374061/Multi-resolution-physics-aware-recurrent</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Understanding and mitigating distribution shifts for universal machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00260E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00260E" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00260E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S.

Herein, we synthesized layered BiOI transparent single crystals through a tellurium-assisted chemical vapor transport strategy. Systematic investigation reveals that tellurium acts as a critical transport agent, directly modulating the crystallization dynamics and enabling the growth of high-quality 1-cm single crystals with precise size control. The layered BiOI crystals demonstrate excellent broadband (254–940 nm) photoresponse performance, achieving a remarkable responsivity of 123.7 A·W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and specific detectivity of 7.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Notably, the implementation of gate voltage regulation allows dynamic control of carrier transport mechanisms, achieving efficient regulation of the photoresponse of the device. This unique gate-tunable characteristic enables dual-mode operation in image recognition systems, simultaneously supporting both high-sensitivity detection and programmable contrast enhancement. The combination of scalable crystal growth and multifunctional optoelectronic properties positions BiOI as a promising candidate for next-generation intelligent photodetection

To address these challenges, recently, in Matter, Tian et al. proposed an innovative “pre-placed vacancy and isomorphous occupancy” strategy to prepare the first A-site high-entropy MAX phase. The entropy-induced lattice distortions and defects optimize impedance matching and enhance polarization loss, thus achieving exceptional microwave absorption.

Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt;, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;LevelsExtractor&lt;/span&gt;, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;SourcesMapper&lt;/span&gt;, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046109/3373556/RTNinja-A-generalized-machine-learning-framework</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A pilot study: Incorporating Treponema pallidum antigens into machine learning models for accurate syphilis treatment outcome assessment</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</link><description>Health informatics; disease; artificial intelligence applications</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[APL Materials Current Issue] Erratum: “Growth of conductive Si-doped α-Ga 2 O 3  by suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy” [APL Mater. 13, 101117 (2025)]</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/129901/3373552/Erratum-Growth-of-conductive-Si-doped-Ga2O3-by</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;In our recently published paper,&lt;a class="reflinks" href="https://pubs.aip.org/rss/site_1000013/1000009.xml#c1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a reference was mistakenly cited as support for our hypothesis on p. 9 that Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; may be converting to Si&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and acting as a compensating defect in α-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Consequently, the use of oxygen-releasing osteogenic materials has been studied extensively in recent years. This study aimed to construct and test a 3D-printed composite scaffold with both angiogenic and bone-repair functions. A “sandwich”-like structure containing polycaprolactone, hydroxyapatite, and calcium peroxide was fabricated using fused deposition modeling 3D printing technology. The polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite/calcium peroxide composite scaffolds exhibited excellent mechanical properties and sustained oxygen release for over three weeks. Compared to the control groups, the polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite/calcium peroxide scaffolds also significantly promoted rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and osteogenic differentiation, with the scaffold containing 1% calcium peroxide showing the most potent pro-angiogenic and bone-repairing effects. In a rat calvarial defect model, radiographic and histological analyses revealed that the synergistic effects of calcium peroxide and hydroxyapatite significantly induced vascular network formation, accelerated bone regeneration across the entire defect area, and markedly enhanced new bone formation. In summary, this work proposes a novel strategy for fabricating cell- and growth factor-free bone tissue engineering scaffolds with potential for tissue regeneration and clinical replacement.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/121101/3373547/3D-printed-oxygen-releasing-scaffolds-promote-bone</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Bathymetry of the Philippine Sea with Convolution Neural Network from Multisource Marine Geodetic Data</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02546-5?rss=yes</link><description>This study developed a deep learning-based method for high resolution bathymetry prediction in the Philippine Sea, aiming to improve the accuracy of seafloor depth estimation using multi-source marine geodetic data.

We present the deterministic characterization with an integrated parallelizable hybrid resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10 kHz throughput with 168.3 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;s inference latency, indicating scalability to 14 kHz with field-programmable gate array integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals.

We create a database of all two-generated subgroups of the symmetric group on n-objects and conduct a classification of finite simple groups among them using shallow feed-forward neural networks. We show that this neural network classifier can decipher the property of simplicity with varying accuracies depending on the features. Our neural network model leads to a natural conjecture concerning the generators of a finite simple group. We subsequently prove this conjecture. This new toy theorem comments on the necessary properties of generators of finite simple groups. We show this explicitly for a class of sporadic groups for which the result holds. Our work further makes the case for a machine motivated study of algebraic structures in pure mathematics and highlights the possibility of generating new conjectures and theorems in mathematics with the aid of machine learning.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1d98</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

To address this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to dramatically boost the performance of red μ-LEDs. Our strategy involves integrating rod-shaped Au nanoparticles into a precisely engineered nanohole pattern. By strategically placing these nanoparticles, we optimize LSPR coupling with the active region of the μ-LEDs, resulting in significant enhancements in light extraction efficiency and reduced radiative recombination rates. Furthermore, we employ a chemical treatment to effectively passivate surface defects, minimizing non-radiative recombination losses. This synergistic approach leads to a substantial increase in both optical output and electroluminescence intensity, pushing the boundaries of red μ-LED performance. The nanohole-patterned μ-LED chips achieve a ∼2.32-fold higher optical output at 50 A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along with an ∼8.96-fold higher electroluminescence, compared to the bare μ-LEDs. A lower lifetime of 0.348 ns for the nanohole-patterned μ-LEDs elucidates the fundamental mechanism of the novel approach with a high energy-coupling efficiency (67%) of the multi-quantum wells through the fast LSP channel.

However, these advantages also introduce challenges in probing and controlling AFM order, thereby restricting their practical application. In this study, we demonstrate an all-electric control and probing of AFM order in heavy metal/AFM insulator heterostructures on a ferroelectric substrate at room temperature. The AFM order was detected by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and manipulated by the ferroelectric field effect as well as the piezoelectric effect in heterostructures of Pt/NiO/0.7Pb(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–0.3PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PMN–PT). The nonvolatile control of AFM order gives rise to a 33% modulation of AHE, which is further evidenced by synchrotron-based x-ray magnetic linear dichroism. Combined with the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; piezoelectric response of AHE, we demonstrate that the ferroelectric polarization contributes mainly to the control of AFM order. Our results are expected to have broader implications for efficient spintronic devices.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041410/3372820/Electrical-modulation-and-probing-of</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Synergistic integration of metasurfaces and quantum photonics: Pathways to next-generation technologies</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041318/3372590/Synergistic-integration-of-metasurfaces-and</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The convergence of metamaterials and quantum optics heralds a transformative era in photonic technologies, poised to revolutionize applications ranging from information processing and imaging to sensing and beyond. This review explores the synergistic integration of metasurfaces—engineered sub-wavelength planar structures—and quantum optics, which exploits quantum mechanical principles to manipulate light at the most granular level. We outline the design principles, fabrication processes, and computational challenges involved in creating quantum metasurfaces, discussing both forward and inverse design approaches. Advances in nanofabrication and intelligent optimization techniques, such as machine learning and topology optimization, have enabled the development of metasurfaces with unparalleled control over electromagnetic waves. We examine recent progress in using quantum metasurfaces for single-photon and multi-photon generation, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing, showcasing how these innovations achieve unprecedented precision and novel functionalities. Additionally, we highlight the integration of metasurfaces into quantum light manipulation, emphasizing their role in enhancing wavefront shaping and entanglement control. By providing a comprehensive survey of current advancements and future research directions, this review highlights the vast potential of metasurfaces and quantum optics at the crossroads, setting the stage for next-generation technological innovations that will define the forthcoming decade.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041318/3372590/Synergistic-integration-of-metasurfaces-and</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Universal machine learning potentials for systems with reduced dimensionality</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</link><description>We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) across systems of varying dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (3D) (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for 3D systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01–0.02 Å and errors in the energy below 10 meV atom−1 across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal MLIPs have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Conjugated polyelectrolyte-aptamer hybrid for organic-electrochemical-transistor-based sensing</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00564-8?rss=yes</link><description>Jiang et al. present biofunctionalized organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), specifically single-component materials that integrate high specificity with semiconducting properties, exemplified by p(NDI-T-ZI/EG)-aptamer.

However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.

Neuromorphic devices with synaptic functions are gradually emerging, which provides hardware support for the construction of brain-like computing systems. As an important branch of neuromorphic devices, synaptic transistors have shown great potential in energy-efficient parallel computing. Among the various types of synaptic transistors, oxide-based synaptic transistors (OSTs) have attracted widespread attention due to their compatibility with silicon technology and operating stability. Herein, the basic functionalities and the latest developments of OSTs are introduced.

TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with its high stability and strong oxidation power, suffers from a wide bandgap that limits its visible-light absorption, whereas MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC), exhibits excellent catalytic properties and a narrow bandgap that enhances light absorption and charge transfer. The MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction effectively overcomes these limitations by facilitating charge separation, suppressing recombination losses, and expanding the light absorption range, making it a promising candidate for sustainable energy applications. Notably, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunctions have demonstrated versatility in PEC systems, functioning effectively as photoanodes and photocathodes. This review provides a detailed overview of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based PEC architectures, including a comparative analysis of their anodic and cathodic roles. Furthermore, recent advances in synthesis strategies, interfacial engineering, charge transfer mechanisms, and performance enhancement techniques have been discussed comprehensively. Additionally, challenges such as interfacial charge recombination, stability issues, and scalable fabrication methods are addressed along with emerging strategies, including defect engineering, plasmonic enhancement, and multi-component heterostructures. By addressing these challenges, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunctions hold great promise for the future of solar-driven hydrogen production and carbon capture technologies, contributing to global efforts toward clean energy and environmental sustainability.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041316/3371767/Advances-in-MoS2-TiO2-heterojunctions-for</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Surface stability modeling with universal machine learning interatomic potentials: a comprehensive cleavage energy benchmarking study</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1408</link><description>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory database of 36 718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our zero-shot evaluation results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10–100× computational speedup. These findings fundamentally reframe MLIP development priorities: highlighting that strategic training-data generation with appropriate non-equilibrium sampling deserves equal or greater attention than architectural complexity.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1408</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Li–Si compound anodes enabling high-performance all-solid-state Li-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</link><description>Li–Si compound anodes, exemplified by Li2.33Si, overcome the degradation issues of conventional Si anodes by combining high ionic and electronic conductivity, favorable mechanical properties, and a negligible-volume-change Li-storage mechanism (Li2.33 + αSi, 0 &lt; α &lt; 0.92), thereby enabling high areal capacity, long cycle life, and fast rate capability in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[APL Energy Current Issue] Tailoring ferroelectricity in Al:HfO 2  capacitors: A comprehensive approach to annealing, electrode selection, and Al dopant distribution</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/3/4/046104/3371306/Tailoring-ferroelectricity-in-Al-HfO2-capacitors-A</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;We systematically investigate the effects of annealing conditions, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycle number and distribution, and top electrode (TE) material on the ferroelectric switching behavior of 10 nm-thick Al-doped HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Al:HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) films. We perform 150 ALD cycles, comprising HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sub-cycles, with precise control over the number and distribution of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles. Post-metallization annealing (PMA) at 600 °C for 3 min induced spontaneous 2 remnant polarization (2P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) through the combined Al-induced lattice stress and TE-induced mechanical stress, promoting orthorhombic phase formation. Optimization to three Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles within the HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bulk balances polarization enhancement and suppression of oxygen-vacancy-induced leakage, yielding a 2P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and endurance up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cycles. The W electrodes, with a low thermal expansion coefficient and smooth surfaces, enable uniform stress transfer and improved dipole alignment compared to Mo and Ru electrodes. Notably, asymmetric localization of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sub-cycles near the lower HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; region, combined with TE-induced stress, maximizes uniform stress distribution across the film.

Conventional techniques are mostly invasive, time-consuming, expensive, sophisticated, and centered at urban facilities. Moreover, they are unable to address the biological complexities related to critical diseases, disorders, and pandemics, resulting in associated high morbidity and mortality. To address this gap, miniaturized fifth-generation sensing chips provide alternatives in terms of accessibility, affordability, and adaptability, being point-of-care and minimally invasive diagnostics. In this context, Breathomic chips based on nanoscale semiconductors have shown their potential for noninvasive, personalized, and on-site operation, offering the capability to identify volatile organic compounds/gases as disease biomarkers from exhaled breath and enabling early disease detection. However, the practical implementation of these sensors in real-time medical contexts remains challenging due to factors including the lack of clinical trials, dedicated data analysis, understanding of the complexities, public awareness, scalability, and accessibility. This comprehensive review critically summarizes the landscape of breath biomarkers detecting fifth-generation chemiresistive chips for human disease diagnosis, methodically outlining associated challenges, alternative strategies, and prospects for clinical implementations and commercial advancement. It details the biological origins of biomarkers, the diverse sensing modalities, and the underlying mechanisms pertaining to breathomic biomarker diagnosis. Furthermore, it highlights the integration of digital-age technologies, including nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and machine learning, for high-performance breathomic chips.

To address this gap, we introduce an affordable, autonomous, Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled experimental platform designed specifically for applied physics education. Utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, a customizable multi-wavelength light emitting diode array, and photosensors, our setup generates diverse, real-time optical datasets ideal for training and evaluating foundational ML algorithms, including traversal methods, Bayesian inference, and deep learning. The platform facilitates a closed-loop, self-driving experimental workflow, encompassing automated data collection, preprocessing, model training, and validation. Through systematic performance comparisons, we demonstrate the superior ability of deep learning to capture complex nonlinear relationships compared to traversal and Bayesian methods. At ∼$60, this open-source IoT platform provides an accessible, practical pathway for students to master advanced ML concepts, promoting deeper conceptual insights and essential technical skills required for the next generation of physicists and engineers.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046105/3369966/Building-an-affordable-self-driving-lab-Practical</guid></item><item><title>[APL Machine Learning Current Issue] Data integration and data fusion approaches in self-driving labs: A perspective</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/040901/3369947/Data-integration-and-data-fusion-approaches-in</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are transforming materials discovery by combining automation, machine learning, and real-time feedback. Yet, their success depends on robust data integration and fusion methods capable of handling materials data that are heterogeneous, sparse, and multi-scale. Such data span theoretical models, simulations, and experimental techniques across diverse spatial and temporal scales, creating significant challenges for interoperability and analysis. This perspective reviews the state-of-the-art techniques, including knowledge graphs, structured pipelines, multimodal machine learning, and physics-informed models, that are enabling materials science and SDLs to unify and learn from disparate data sources, identify critical challenges, and propose forward-looking directions to enhance data readiness, interoperability, and predictive power in SDLs. We also highlight emerging methods such as transformer architectures, zero-shot learning, and real-time stream processing, and discuss the critical need for more scalable, interpretable, and adaptive solutions to fully realize autonomous materials innovation. By mapping out both the current landscape and future opportunities, we argue that next-generation data integration and fusion are not just enablers but essential pillars for achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and intelligent SDL systems capable of addressing the complexities of hierarchical and multifunctional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/040901/3369947/Data-integration-and-data-fusion-approaches-in</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Machine learning anomaly detection of automated HPLC experiments in the cloud laboratory</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00253B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00253B" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3445-3454&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00253B, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Filipp Gusev, Benjamin C.

However, conventional approaches rely primarily on chemical and electrical doping and focus mainly on local electrical or optical measurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain. Magneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated modulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical measurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and ferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically coupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime.

However, their practical deployment is hindered by persistent challenges—dendritic growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), and severe volumetric expansion. Emerging as a transformative solution, three-dimensional (3D) printing enables the rational design of multiscale architectures (e.g., micro-lattice anodes and gradient-porous cathodes) and hybrid solid-state electrolytes to address these limitations. This review presents a pioneering synthesis of 3D printing's role in lithium-metal battery engineering, focusing on its capacity to regulate lithium-ion flux, stabilize SEIs, and suppress dendrite proliferation through hierarchical structural control. We systematically analyze four key additive manufacturing technologies (inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and stereolithography), delineating their unique advantages in tailoring ion transport pathways and mechanical robustness. Furthermore, we propose multi-material co-printing strategies to resolve interfacial incompatibilities in monolithic lithium-metal batteries, a critical barrier in current research. By bridging additive manufacturing with electrochemical fundamentals, this work outlines a roadmap to harness 3D printing's full potential, addressing scalability challenges and advancing applications in aerospace, wearables, and biomedical devices where energy density and safety are paramount.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041310/3369005/3D-printed-lithium-metal-batteries-Multiscale</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Harnessing Large Language Models to Advance Microbiome Research: From Sequence Analysis to Clinical Applications</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500038?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500038</guid></item><item><title>[Newton] Mapping the three-dimensional structure of faceted gold mesocrystals using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging</title><link>https://www.cell.com/newton/fulltext/S2950-6360(25)00261-0?rss=yes</link><description>Understanding the structure-property relationship of self-assembled superstructures requires non-destructive 3D structural analysis, which can then facilitate the development of mesocrystals with collective and emergent properties.

The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form being used as independent loss components (here , where n is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant ). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, , for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian J. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1117</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] SpectroGen: A physically informed generative artificial intelligence for accelerated cross-modality spectroscopic materials characterization</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00477-1?rss=yes</link><description>SpectroGen seamlessly couples physics-driven distribution models with a variable autoencoder to generate synthetic spectra indistinguishable from real data.

In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041305/3366934/The-enduring-legacy-of-scanning-spreading</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: InfoMat: Table of Contents] Multi‐defect‐engineering in ZnO/GO heterostructures for optoelectronic synaptic devices with ultra‐high dynamic range and low energy consumption</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/inf2.70089?af=R</link><description>InfoMat, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: InfoMat: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 16:00:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/inf2.70089</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Oxygen Vacancy-Modulated Molybdenum Oxide/Montmorillonite Heterointerface Nanoarchitectures for Plasmon-Enhanced Solar-Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/762823f9-fd0a-4aff-acde-289220f569a8/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132&lt;/div&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes with precise ion transport kinetics hold transformative potential for next-generation ion-selective membranes, yet their practical implementation in osmotic energy conversion remains constrained by inherent ...</description><author>Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Constructing and explaining machine learning models for the exploration and design of boron-based Lewis acids</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00212E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00212E" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3623-3634&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00212E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Juliette Fenogli, Laurence Grimaud, Rodolphe Vuilleumier&lt;br /&gt;Bridging ML and chemical intuition, interpretable models predict Lewis acidity with high accuracy and reveal design rules for tailoring boron-based Lewis acids.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00212E</guid></item><item><title>[APL Machine Learning Current Issue] Deep learning model of myofilament cooperative activation and cross-bridge cycling in cardiac muscle</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046101/3365811/Deep-learning-model-of-myofilament-cooperative</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Cardiac muscle contraction is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, where myosin heads generate force by cyclically attaching to and pulling on actin filaments using energy from ATP. Modeling this process is central to understanding cardiac sarcomere mechanics. In this study, we developed supervised machine learning (ML) models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate cross-bridge cycling and muscle behavior under isosarcometric, isometric, and isotonic conditions. Trained on synthetic data, the ANN captured nonlinear dependencies among calcium concentration, stiffness, sarcomere length, temperature, and force output. Error analysis through histograms and unity-line scatterplots validated prediction accuracy and identified underfitting and overfitting patterns.

These natural carriers deliver various molecules into cells, including proteins and nucleic acids. There are numerous methods to load and modify EVs, encompassing physical, chemical, and biological approaches. EVs demonstrate the capacity to target specific cells within organs, even requiring blood–tissue transition. The protein corona significantly influences EV availability and cargo delivery, with biomolecules residing both within and conjugated to the EV membrane. Furthermore, embedding EVs within biomaterials such as hydrogels, scaffolds, and nanofibers can enhance their stability, targeting specificity, and therapeutic potential. By addressing cargo loading and cell/tissue-specific targeting, EVs offer a novel therapeutic strategy for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, EVs show promise as vaccination tools, delivering messenger RNA and proteins of various pathogens. Advances in EV biology and engineering would provide improved strategies for vesicle targeting, enhanced cargo loading, and safe and effective delivery. The convergence of technological advancements, interdisciplinary collaboration, and an enhanced understanding of EVs promises to revolutionize therapeutic approaches to a wide range of diseases, establishing EV-based treatments as a cornerstone of future medicine.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041301/3365609/Extracellular-vesicles-as-the-drug-delivery</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Topological thermal crystalline insulators</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041401/3365605/Topological-thermal-crystalline-insulators</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The disclination of a bulk crystalline lattice could host strongly localized states protected by quantized fractional charges, known as disclination states. Although disclination states of topological crystalline insulators have been extensively explored in wave systems, i.e., electromagnetic and acoustic wave systems, their experimental realizations in the diffusion process, particularly thermal diffusion, have remained underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, we theoretically model and experimentally measure topologically protected disclination states in C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric thermal crystalline lattices composed of aluminum disks. The temperature evolution is tied to an effective Hamiltonian hosting topological disclination modes, which have a diffusion rate that is robust against defects.

Our method suppresses periodic self‐interactions via supercell expansion, builds a continuous potential energy surface (PES) from MLFF energies on a spatial grid, and extracts minimum‐energy pathways without predefined nudged elastic band (NEB) images. For a benchmark set of twelve electrode and electrolyte materials, including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li10GeP2S12, our MLFF‐derived barriers lie within tens of meV of density functional theory (DFT) and experiment values, while achieving a ∼100-fold speedup over standard DFT‐NEB calculations. We benchmark GPTFF, CHGNet, and MACE, showing that fine‐tuning on PBE/PBE + U data further enhances accuracy.

While traditional mechanical exfoliation methods can produce high-quality flakes, they suffer from poor reproducibility and low yield. In recent years, metal-assisted exfoliation techniques have significantly improved monolayer yield and structural uniformity. Furthermore, scalable transfer strategies such as polyvinyl alcohol-assisted transfer and van der Waals integration have achieved cleaner interfaces and higher alignment accuracy. However, manual operation remains a major limitation to consistency and efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative tool, enabling intelligent control of the exfoliation and transfer process through real-time parameter optimization, crack prevention, and path planning. Deep learning architectures facilitate layer identification and defect detection, while reinforcement learning enables high-precision autonomous robotic manipulation. This article systematically reviews the latest advances in the field of 2D material exfoliation and transfer, highlighting the important role of AI in addressing core process bottlenecks and enabling the scalable, reliable, and automated fabrication of 2D materials.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae0353</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] 4D-MISR: a unified model for low-dose super-resolution imaging via feature fusion</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae05b6</link><description>While an electron microscope offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into structure–property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of the conventional method by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution that had been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances this reconstruction with a convolutional neural network that integrates features from synthetic, multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic evaluations on representative materials demonstrate the comparable spatial resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra low-dose conditions. Our work one-step expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable method for the structural analysis of any radiation-vulnerable material.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae05b6</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] 3D-printed scaffold loaded baicalin-preconditioned exosomes promote bone defect repair via mediating PRRX2 to alleviate inflammation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01826-7?rss=yes</link><description>Chronic nonunion of bone defects remains a significant challenge in orthopedic treatment.

This work establishes A-site HE engineering as a powerful approach for tailoring MAX phase properties.</description><author>Matter</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00410-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Macrophage Phenotype Detection Methodology on Textured Surfaces via Nuclear Morphology Using Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500055?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 08:40:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500055</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] CrossMatAgent: AI‐Assisted Design of Manufacturable Metamaterial Patterns via Multi‐Agent Generative Framework</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500063?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 08:24:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500063</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Topology‐Aware Machine Learning for High‐Throughput Screening of MOFs in C8 Aromatic Separation</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500079?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 10:45:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500079</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in PRX Energy] Origin of Intrinsically Low Thermal Conductivity in a Garnet-Type Solid Electrolyte: Linking Lattice and Ionic Dynamics with Thermal Transport</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/6wj2-kzhh</link><description>Author(s): Yitian Wang, Yaokun Su, Jesús Carrete, Huanyu Zhang, Nan Wu, Yutao Li, Hongze Li, Jiaming He, Youming Xu, Shucheng Guo, Qingan Cai, Douglas L.

Such devices are useful if the magnetization can be manipulated electrically rather than by magnetic fields. This review covers the materials, underlying physics, and applications involved in such manipulation, focusing on two control mechanisms. The first is control by manipulating the magnetization through its coupling to ferroelectric order and the second is control by spin-polarized currents manipulating the magnetization through the angular momentum flowing into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/RevModPhys.96.015005.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Rev.

Ramesh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topology provides a framework for an understanding of emergent phenomena in various fields such as the appearance of new results in the field of ferroelectrics. A historical introduction and a primer on the concepts of topology are followed by a discussion of experimental and theoretical methods that elucidate the exotic textures that appear in polar oxide nanostructures and superlattices. The complex interplay of several fundamental processes occurring on different energy scales leads to ground states that compete with one another and have large and/or novel responses with respect to external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/RevModPhys.95.025001.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Rev.
