Abstract: Lithium and sodium are the only solids that are known to lose crystalline order upon cooling. The seemingly-disordered low-temperature phase shows signatures of various close-packed structures. The lack of order has been attributed to a hidden gauge symmetry that arises when electrons from one layer can hop to a neighbouring layer but not further. It makes all close-packed structures nearly degenerate and leads to ``structural frustration''. In this article, we examine whether this symmetry is reflected in transport signatures. Taking advantage of in-plane translational periodicity, we map the bulk Bloch Hamiltonian to an effective one-dimensional chain, with stacking disorder mapping to random phases of the hopping amplitudes. We derive an explicit analytic form for the Green's function of electrons and use it to calculate conductance of a bulk crystal. When hopping in the effective one-dimensional chain is restricted to nearest neighbours, conductance is completely insensitive to phase disorder, which indicates that all close-packed structures exhibit the same conductance. We show that the leading correction that can differentiate between close-packed structures arises from hopping to the next-nearest-neighbour layer, equivalent to second-neighbour hopping in the chain model. This process appears when a pair of next-neighbour layers are aligned in a certain way, e.g., at an hcp-like stacking fault within an fcc background. With this hopping included, conductance becomes sensitive to the precise arrangement of layers. When multiple stacking faults are present, the conductance decreases with increasing system size, as expected from Anderson localization. Our results are applicable to pressurized lithium and sodium, where conductance measurements can identify and characterize stacking faults.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18574v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Real-time vacancy concentration evolution revealed via heavy ion irradiation experiments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18608</link><description>arXiv:2602.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in situ ion irradiation transient grating spectroscopy (I3TGS) can be used to monitor the real-time evolution of vacancy concentration generated by self-ion radiation damage in Cu-based alloys. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequencies are shown, using a combination of theory and experiment, to reveal vacancy concentrations and their kinetics in real-time. These results are shown to agree with corresponding kinetic Monte Carlo simulations at similar temperatures and dose rates. These results suggest the utility of TGS as a non-contact, non-destructive tool for real-time defect monitoring.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18608v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Work-hardening exhaustion as the origin of low toughness in L-PBF alloys: A case study on the role of intrinsic vs. extrinsic defects in SS316L</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18954</link><description>arXiv:2602.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing offers a remarkable balance of strength and ductility across many structural alloys. However, L-PBF alloys often display much lower fracture toughness, in some cases up to 70% below conventionally wrought counterparts. The reasons for this toughness paradox have remained elusive, since conventional tools cannot directly visualize sub-surface microscale deformation processes that govern crack growth. Here we apply scanning 3D X-ray diffraction and phase contrast tomography to simultaneously capture microstructural evolution with 1 micron resolution near an advancing crack tip, utilizing 316L stainless steel as a model system. We demonstrate that the toughness paradox is not solely a consequence of extrinsic processing defects or residual stresses, but rather an intrinsic failure to relax crack-tip stresses via plasticity. While wrought material facilitates stable crack-tip blunting through localized dislocation accumulation, the L-PBF material undergoes premature work-hardening saturation that triggers extreme stress partitioning and high stress triaxiality. This results in a transition from ductile blunting to a sharp, unstable fracture mode. These findings identify work-hardening exhaustion as a systemic vulnerability inherent to L-PBF microstructures, where the exceptional initial dislocation density required for high yield strength acts as a saturation ceiling for damage tolerance. This work provides a physical basis for adapting damage models to L-PBF metals and challenges the assumption that high tensile ductility guarantees fracture resistance in rapidly solidified components.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hidden Chiral Ferroelectricity in AgNbO$_3$ Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19036</link><description>arXiv:2602.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AgNbO$_3$ is a lead-free perovskite with considerable potential for energy storage and optoelectronic applications, yet its low-temperature crystal structure has remained controversial. In this Letter, we revisit its low-energy structural landscape using a systematic first-principles structural search based on symmetry-adapted phonon-mode theory. We uncover a previously unreported chiral ferroelectric phase with space group $R3$, which exhibits a large spontaneous polarization and a low polarization switching barrier, enabling polarization reversal under electric fields. Crucially, the structural chirality of this phase is intrinsically locked to the ferroelectric polarization, allowing electrical control of the chiral handedness. Consequently, chiral optical responses--including circular dichroism, circular photogalvanic effect, optical activity, and second-order nonlinear optics--can be reversibly switched by an external electric field. These results not only clarify the complex low-temperature structural behavior of AgNbO$_3$ but also establish a rare purely inorganic platform for electric-field-tunable chirality, opening a pathway toward ultrafast, electrically controlled chiral optoelectronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Precompression engineering of metal-insulator transition and magnetism in designed breathing kagome systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19147</link><description>arXiv:2602.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials featuring dispersive Dirac cones and topological flat bands exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, kagome compounds with tunable electrical conductivity remain scarce, which severely impedes their device applications. Here, based on density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory, we introduce the breathing effect into kagome materials $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) via chemical precompression, thereby inducing a metal-insulator transition and magnetic variation. We determine that the band structures, optical absorption spectra and magnetic ground states agree well with experimental results at the effective correlation strength $U_{\text{eff}} = 2$ eV. The calculated conductivity and magnetic properties reveal that the monolayer $\mathrm{Nb_3Cl_8}$ and $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ undergoes transitions from paramagnetic metals to Mott insulators at $U_{\text{eff}} = 1$ eV and $t_{\text{out}}/t_{\text{in}} = 0.6674$, respectively. Our detailed analysis establishes that the stronger breathing effect corresponds to enhanced chemical precompression, which reduces the region of free electron gas between intercell Nb atoms and facilitates the metal-insulator transition. Finally, we propose several viable synthesis routes for $\mathrm{Nb_3FCl_7}$, $\mathrm{Nb_3BrCl_7}$, and $\mathrm{Nb_3ICl_7}$, providing predictive guidance for experimental studies. Our study establishes a practical framework for investigating the breathing effect in correlated kagome systems and yields valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transition and magnetic properties in real breathing kagome materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Constrained Diffusion for Accelerated Structure Relaxation of Inorganic Solids with Point Defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19153</link><description>arXiv:2602.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects affect material properties by altering electronic states and modifying local bonding environments. However, high-throughput first-principles simulations of point defects are costly due to large simulation cells and complex energy landscapes. To this end, we propose a generative framework for simulating point defects, overcoming the limits of costly first-principles simulators. By leveraging a primal-dual algorithm, we introduce a constraint-aware diffusion model which outperforms existing constrained diffusion approaches in this domain. Across six defect configuration settings for Bi2Te3, the proposed approach provides state-of-the-art performance generating physically grounded structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the anomalous elasticity in the mechanical response of amorphous solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19299</link><description>arXiv:2602.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of amorphous solids to a mechanical perturbation consists in an elastic and a plastic deformation. The latter is mediated by localized irreversible rearrangements associated with Eshelby-like quadrupolar singularities in the displacement field. It has recently been argued that a density of such singularities leads to an anomalous elastic behavior taking the form of screening effects, which goes beyond classical elastic predictions. Here, we reexamine this scenario using general theoretical arguments and a description in terms of an elasto-plastic model, which we compare with atomistic simulations of the canonical Eshelby inclusion geometry. We discuss the conditions under which a finite, i.e., nonvanishing, density of quadrupolar events is created by an imposed perturbation. We argue that, except when the perturbation is macroscopic, there are many situations in which the density of quadrupolar defects is zero in the thermodynamic limit. In these cases, we find that plastically active quadrupoles emerge in a region whose size generically scales as the spatial extent $\ell$ of the mechanical perturbation. This mechanism leads to anomalous elasticity on a scale $\ell$ close to the perturbation and to conventional elasticity beyond. The simulations of the elasto-plastic model reproduce the emergence of plastic quadrupoles in a region set by $\ell$ and the associated renormalization of the effective shear modulus, but they do not exhibit the dipole-screening signatures reported in atomistic and experimental studies. Our analysis delineates the scale-dependent breakdown of long-wavelength elasticity in amorphous materials and suggests directions for incorporating anomalous screening into mesoscopic modeling frameworks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19299v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theory of strained quantum emitters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19640</link><description>arXiv:2602.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors acting as optically active spin qubits are intriguing objects of fundamental study and future technological developments. These defect-based color centers are of particular interest for detection and response to physical variations such as pressure and strain. To investigate the defect emission response to strain, we have studied the vibrational structure of the negatively charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$) in 4H-SiC under applied tensile and compressive uniaxial strain using first-principles calculations. The strain variations of the emission spectrum can be explained by differing responses of bulk-like and quasi-localized vibrational modes. In particular, substantial differences are found between the hexagonal ($h$) and quasicubic ($k$) configurations of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$ in 4H-SiC that result in a strain-induced improvement of the Debye-Waller factor for $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}(h)$ under $+2\%$ uniaxial strain along the $a$-axis of 4H-SiC. Finally, strain-dependent changes in the phonon sideband enable distinguishing between compressive and tensile strain, opening up the possibility of magnetic field-free strain detection using only spin-conserving transitions of solid-state quantum emitters.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19640v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optical properties of single CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots synthesized by a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19693</link><description>arXiv:2602.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (pQDs) are promising quantum light emitters, and investigations at the single pQD scale have so far relied mostly on hot-injection synthesis, which requires precise temperature control and an inert atmosphere. While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Separation of the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism from Quantum Criticality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19865</link><description>arXiv:2602.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a system is swept through a quantum critical point (QCP), the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts that the average number of topological defects follows a universal power-law scaling with the ramp time scale. This scaling behavior is determined by the equilibrium critical exponents of the underlying phase transition. We show that the correspondence between Kibble-Zurek scaling and quantum criticality does not hold generally. In particular, the defect density can exhibit a suppression faster than the Kibble-Zurek prediction even when the quench crosses a critical point, while conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling may persist for quenches through a non-critical point. Our results, based on models representative of a broad class of quasi-one-dimensional Fermi systems, identify the dynamical conditions under which universal defect scaling emerges and clarify the relation between defect generation and equilibrium criticality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cr3+ spin dynamics under the octahedral crystal field in van der Waals antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20033</link><description>arXiv:2602.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic moment in van der Waals (vdW) materials containing 3d transition metals originates from unpaired d-electron spins and their interaction with surrounding ligands. The interplay between exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy stabilizes long-range ordering of such moments. The compound CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) presents an interesting class of vdW solids where the coupling of Cr3+ moments and ordering of Cu1+ ions give rise to a multiferroic ground state. Here we investigate the spin dynamics of Cr3+ ions in CCPS through magnetization and broadband as well as single sub-THz magnetic resonance measurements. The orbital moment of Cr3+ is quenched under the octahedral crystal field of surrounding chalcogen ions, resulting in negligible magnetic anisotropy-a feature common to Cr-based vdW antiferromagnets (AFM). Resonance spectra over a wide frequency-field-temperature range reveal quasi-2D AFM dynamics governed mainly by isotropic Cr-Cr exchange interactions, which determine the magnetic order, spin reorientation, and damping. Sub-THz resonance spectra also uncover a field-induced ferromagnetic polarization, highlighting the universal role of Cr-Cr exchange in layered Cr compounds. Moreover, persistent magnetic correlations far above the N\'eel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) points to short-range magnetic order in CCPS and motivates future studies of a possible interplay between AFM and antiferroelectric orders. These results establish CCPS as an exemplary system for exploring 2D magnetism and electric-field-tunable spintronic functionalities in layered multiferroics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20033v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Role of octahedral tilting induced acoustic softening on limiting thermal transport in SrSnO3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20142</link><description>arXiv:2602.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Octahedral tilting is a fundamental structural distortion in perovskites, governing key phenomena such as lattice stabilizing, soft phonon dynamics, group-theoretical analysis, phase transitions, ferroelectricity, and even for tunable electronic band gap. However, its influence on lattice thermal conductivity (kL) remains poorly understood. In the archetypal perovskite SrTiO3, tilting in the low-temperature tetragonal phase is known to enhance kL by suppressing specific phonon scattering channels around 200 cm-1. Here, we investigate the thermal transport in strontium stannate (SrSnO3), another perovskite oxide that undergoes temperature-driven phase transitions, and reveal a completely opposite effect. Through a systematic study across its orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, we demonstrate that octahedral tilting in the tetragonal phase of SrSnO3 anomalously triggers acoustic phonon softening. This softening manifests as reduced frequencies and group velocities in low-frequency (&lt;3 THz) acoustic modes, creating a large decrease for heat transport, particularly along the c-axis. Consequently, kL is significantly suppressed, decreasing from 7.48 W m-1 K-1 to 6.06 W m-1 K-1 as the tilting angle increases by a mere 1 degree. These findings identify tilting-induced acoustic softening as a pivotal mechanism for limiting and controlling anisotropic thermal transport in SrSnO3, presenting a stark contrast to the established behavior in SrTiO3.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes on group-valued qudits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19558</link><description>arXiv:2602.19558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a versatile quantum error-correcting family built out of commuting $X$- and $Z$-type checks. We introduce CSS-like codes on $G$-valued qudits for any finite group $G$ that reduce to qubit CSS codes for $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$ yet generalize the Kitaev quantum double model for general groups. The $X$-checks of our group-CSS codes correspond to left and/or right multiplication by group elements, while $Z$-checks project onto solutions to group word equations. We describe quantum-double models on oriented two-dimensional CW complexes (which need not cellulate a manifold) and prove that, when $G$ is non-Abelian and simple, every $G$-covariant group-CSS code with suitably upper-bounded $Z$-check weight and lower-bounded $Z$-distance reduces to a CW quantum double. We describe the codespace and logical operators of CW quantum doubles via the same intuition used to obtain logical structure of surface codes. We obtain distance bounds for codes on non-Abelian simple groups from the graph underlying the CW complex, and construct intrinsically non-Abelian code families with asymptotically optimal rate and distances. Adding "ghost vertices" to the CW complex generalizes quantum double models with defects and rough boundary conditions whose logical structure can be understood without reference to non-Abelian anyons or defects. Several non-invertible symmetry-protected topological states, both with ordinary and higher-form symmetries, are the unique codewords of simply-connected CW quantum doubles with a single ghost vertex.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19558v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy Rydberg levels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19824</link><description>arXiv:2602.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly excited Rydberg states of lanthanides are a promising, yet largely unexplored, playground for quantum studies. Here, we report on the first high-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy obtained by two-color trap depletion spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap. The absolute excitation frequency of over 700 states with effective principal quantum number n between 21 and 130 is measured with an accuracy of 20 MHz. Most states are assigned to the 8 different series converging to the first 4f10(5I8)6s(2S1/2) J = 17/2 ionization potential. This energy is measured at EIP = 47901.8265 +/- 0.0008 cm-1, improving the precision of the literature value by over an order of magnitude. A multichannel quantum defect theory approach is used to benchmark and refine the assignments and to characterize six observed perturbing states belonging to higher ionization limits. These results pave the way for using dysprosium in Rydberg-based quantum architectures, leveraging the unique properties arising from its complex electronic structure. They also represent a compelling benchmark for ab-initio calculations of open-shell atomic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15906</link><description>arXiv:2505.15906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.15906v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nucleation and Antiphase Twin Control in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Step-Terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ Substrates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18103</link><description>arXiv:2505.18103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrate interaction. In this study, it is shown that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3{\deg}) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First-principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate properties, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.18103v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defects in Wigner crystals: fracton-elasticity duality and vacancy proliferation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14344</link><description>arXiv:2509.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions, their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in charged crystals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14344v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cation vacancies mediate thermochemical water splitting with iron aluminates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05328</link><description>arXiv:2510.05328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar thermochemical water splitting enables hydrogen production by cycling metal oxides between reduced and oxidized states, typically through an oxygen vacancy mechanism. However, recent experimental work suggests that cation vacancies have a greater influence on the redox behavior of iron aluminate spinels used in water splitting. This remains debated, as calculations predict that such cation vacancies are thermodynamically unfavorable. In the current work, we show that Fe vacancies in (Fe$\zeta$Al1-$\zeta$)3O4 become accessible only when facilitated by inversion between Fe and Al. This antisite disorder lowers the formation energy of octahedral Fe vacancies in Al-rich spinels ($\zeta$ = 1/3) from over 3 eV to just 0.62 eV when one third of the cation sites are inverted, allowing high Fe vacancy concentrations under oxidizing conditions. This mechanism supports high H2 yields up to 361 $\mu$mol/g, consistent with experimental observations. Our findings support the notion that solar thermochemical water splitting can occur through a cation vacancy mechanism. They also clarify how site inversion, vacancy energetics, and defect interactions each contribute to redox performance, offering general design principles for identifying and optimizing materials that operate through cation vacancy cycling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05328v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Experimental confirmation of the magnetic ordering transition induced by an electronic structure change in the metallic triangular antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03999</link><description>arXiv:2511.03999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to \textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface (FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co 3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the charge-self-consistent DFT+DMFT band structures and the random phase approximation indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector (1/2,0,0) split into (1/6,0,0) and (1/2,0,0), which is consistent with the magnetic phase transition around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.03999v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sub-1-Angstrom-Resolution Imaging Reveals Phase Contrast Transition in Ice Ih Caused by Basal Stacking Faults</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14920</link><description>arXiv:2602.14920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of $(\frac{2}{3} a_{1} + \frac{1}{3} a_{2})$, produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [111] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14920v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Approaching theoretical polarization limit in HfZrO2/HfLaO2 multilayers</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69634-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 24 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69634-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69634-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;HfO2-based ferroelectric materials are promising for non-volatile memory applications.

Abstract: Scale invariance is a central organizing principle in physics, underlying phenomena that range from critical behaviour in statistical mechanics to transport and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Irradiation-Driven Recrystallization in Fusion-Grade Tungsten: A Mesoscale, Microstructure-Aware Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17988</link><description>arXiv:2602.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten (W) is the leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in fusion reactors, yet its upper operational temperature is limited by premature grain growth and recrystallization processes. Irradiation adds further complications by generating defect clusters and transmutation products that alter both the driving forces and kinetics of grain boundary motion. In this work, we develop a physics-based, multiscale framework that couples crystal plasticity, stochastic cluster dynamics, and discrete grain boundary dynamics to model the co-evolution of plastic deformation, irradiation damage, and grain growth in fusion-grade tungsten polycrystals. The approach enables simulations on realistic microstructures with arbitrary grain size and misorientation distributions, without recourse to mean-field simplifications. The model captures (i) the spatial heterogeneity of dislocation density distribution during hot working; (ii) irradiation-induced defect accumulation under fusion conditions, and (iii) the buildup of chemical and elastic driving forces for grain boundary migration and microstructural evolution. Parametric studies demonstrate the dominant influence that temperature has on thermally activated grain-boundary mobility, a weaker dependence on prior strain, and a pronounced retardation of recrystallization by rhenium segregation arising from neutron transmutation. Under fusion energy irradiation conditions, our framework predicts a substantial reduction of the effective recrystallization temperature relative to unirradiated microstructures, while Re production restores and even elevates this limit. By providing quantitative projections of recrystallization kinetics and in-service recrystallization temperatures, this work establishes a predictive tool for assessing the lifetime and operational envelope of W-based plasma-facing materials under fusion conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17988v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Computational Study of Organic Molecular Crystals for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18200</link><description>arXiv:2602.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic crystalline materials are potential candidates for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS). Although organic crystals have been heavily investigated for application in organic electronics, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and solar cells, there have been comparatively fewer studies into OWS in these materials. A major challenge is the large number of electronic and structural criteria that must be met for a material to make a viable OWS photocatalyst. Optical absorption, reduction and oxidation potentials and charge-transport properties are among the key considerations, and these are influenced both by molecular properties and the solid-state packing arrangement, making computational modelling challenging. Here, we investigate a series of known organic electronic materials that have published crystal structures using periodic density functional theory (DFT) and compare their calculated electronic properties of optical absorption and reduction and oxidation potentials with literature experimental data. Furthermore we perform a series of gas-phase molecular calculations which show a good agreement with literature data and periodic DFT for the optoelectronic properties of the organic molecular crystals studied, showing that gas-phase molecular calculations could be used to screen organic crystals for OWS at a reduced computational cost.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Large Pyroelectric Enhancement in Freestanding Epitaxial BaTiO3 Membranes on Si</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18267</link><description>arXiv:2602.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric membranes transferred onto arbitrary substrates provide reduced mechanical clamping at the interfaces that can diminish the effective polarization-rotation barrier offering a pathway to engineer larger electromechanical and thermally driven responses in oxide electronics. Here, we report integration of single crystalline thin film BaTiO3 (BTO) ferroelectric membrane on Si and demonstrate a 4x at 30C and 34x at 60C enhancement of pyroelectric coefficient compared to clamped films. The BTO membrane is grown epitaxially on a water-soluble Sr3Al2O6 sacrificial layer, released by selective dissolution, and transferred onto Si, yielding a strain-relaxed membrane with robust intrinsic polarization. Temperature dependent piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) reveals pronounced thermally driven evolution of domain orientation, consistent with reduced barriers for dipolar modulation in the freestanding state. Variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) quantifies an effective pyroelectric coefficient of ~75 uC/m^2K at 30C and 450 uC/m^2K at 60C with a detectivity of 40 m^2K^-1at room temperature. These results establish lead-free freestanding BTO membranes as a promising silicon-integrable platform for cryogen-free infrared detection and waste-heat energy management.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18267v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mitigation of Magnetic Flux Trapping in Superconducting Electronics Using Moats</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18345</link><description>arXiv:2602.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux (vortex) trapping remains a major obstacle to very large scale integration in superconducting electronics. Moats -- etched regions in circuit layers placed in ground planes and around critical circuitry -- offer a simple passive approach to sequester flux. Here, we systematically examine the effectiveness of moat arrays in superconducting niobium films as a function of geometry (size, shape, and density) and background magnetic field. By measuring the vortex expulsion field, we estimate the flux saturation number and flux trapping temperature for a range of geometries. We find that many moat designs effectively sequester flux in magnetically shielded environments (&lt; 1 $\mu$T), with high-aspect-ratio rectangular "slit" moats providing the strongest mitigation at minimal area cost. However, our measurements show that moats alone do not eliminate flux trapping in non-ideal films, as vortices can preferentially pin at material defects. These results provide design guidance for flux mitigation in superconducting integrated circuits and highlight the need for combined optimization of circuit geometries and materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18345v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stable Long-Horizon Spatiotemporal Prediction on Meshes Using Latent Multiscale Recurrent Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18146</link><description>arXiv:2602.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlated topological band structures of the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01005</link><description>arXiv:2405.01005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may lead to novel quantum phenomena with potential applications. First-principles calculations are critical for guiding experimental discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga), which were believed to exhibit large anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal critical importance of beyond-DFT treatments on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and topological properties: (1) establishment of noncollinear altermagnetic orders, (2) weakly renormalized band structures in excellent agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment, and (3) sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes. Our work provides a unified basis for understanding topological properties of the Mn$_3X$ family, which challenges previous experimental interpretations based on DFT band structures and predicts potentially higher anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Ga under electron doping. This underscores the importance of a correlation-aware framework beyond DFT in understanding topological magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.01005v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamics of Wound Closure in Living Nematic Epithelia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04922</link><description>arXiv:2506.04922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the closure of a wound in a layer of epithelial cells in a living tissue after damage. Our analysis is informed by our recent experiments observing re-epithelialisation in vivo of Drosophila pupae. On time and length-scales such that the evolution of the epithelial tissue near the wound is well captured by that of a 2D active fluid with local nematic order, we consider the free-surface problem of a hole in a bounded region of tissue, and study the role that active stresses far from the hole play in the closure of the hole. For parallel anchored nematic order at the wound boundary (as we observe in our experiments), we find that closure is accelerated when the active stresses are contractile and slowed down when the stresses are extensile. Parallel anchoring also leads to the appearance of topological defects which annihilate upon wound closure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04922v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16474</link><description>arXiv:2511.16474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic inorganic semiconductors are promising candidates for high performance stable flexible electronics. Germanium based chalcogenide materials are well known for excellent semiconducting properties, specifically superior carrier mobility. However, these materials typically exhibit inherent brittleness, which in germanium tellurides originates from the intrinsic half bond nature of the metavalent Ge Te bond. Here, we report an ultra high plasticity germanium based chalcogenide of GaGeTe. Bulk GaGeTe can sustain a large engineering strain up to 7.5% without fracture. Through a comprehensive multi scale investigation ranging from macroscopic characterization to atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that the exceptional plasticity is due to a synergistic effect of interlayer gliding and intralayer lattice distortion. DFT calculations further elucidate the chemical origin. The existence of Ga atoms avoids the formation of brittle metavalent Ge Te bonds. Instead, a robust honeycomb lattice formed by strong Ga Te, Ge Ge, and Ga Ge bonds preserves high bond strength under large tensile strains in simulations, thereby underpinning the macroscopic plastic behavior. This systematic study on the origin of the plasticity in GaGeTe introduces bond engineering as a potential approach for constructing plastic inorganic semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16474v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18852</link><description>arXiv:2601.18852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18852v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09262</link><description>arXiv:2602.09262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains in the nanoparticles are absent too. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles was not explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes higher-order contributions together with trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale hafnia-zirconia, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its support by shell-induced chemical stress.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09262v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Author Correction: Mechanically reliable and electronically uniform monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by passivation and defect healing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69649-w</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 23 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69649-w"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69649-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Mechanically reliable and electronically uniform monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by passivation and defect healing</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69649-w</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

The absorption region of the QD PDs consists of eight stacked QD layers. Compared with the p-doped PDs, the co-doped PDs achieve a record-low dark current of 0.91 pA and a higher photocurrent because of additional electrons effectively passivating the defects by n-type doping. Furthermore, the co-doping technique provides two different types of impurities, which generates a stronger built-in electric field in the QDs and thereby increases the maximum 3 dB bandwidth of the QD PDs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/8/083304/3380943/Reduced-dark-current-InAs-GaAs-quantum-dot</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Fluorescence lifetime imaging with cost-efficient time-correlated photon counter</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/8/083305/3380879/Fluorescence-lifetime-imaging-with-cost-efficient</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Fluorescence lifetime measurement is a versatile tool for studying the dynamics of biological, chemical, and quantum systems. However, commercially available time-correlated single-photon counting systems are typically very costly and are limited in terms of flexibility. Here, we present the use of a cost-efficient time-to-digital converter chip as a time-correlated single-photon counting module and the integration of the module into a confocal microscopy system to perform fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The system can withstand a sustained count rate of 10 000 counts per second with a timing uncertainty less than 170 ps full width at half maximum. FLIM measurement is obtained by scanning the confocal microscope over the sample and acquiring photon arrival times at each position, where the fluorescence lifetime is then computed using the fit-free center of mass method. The combined system is verified by imaging of fluorescence microbeads with known lifetimes, and we demonstrate the use of the system for imaging single-photon emitters with the nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond. This timing module and calculation method can be used as a standalone upgrade kit for an existing microscope to enable FLIM measurement in biological studies and medical diagnosis applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/8/083305/3380879/Fluorescence-lifetime-imaging-with-cost-efficient</guid></item><item><title>[APL Materials Current Issue] Effect of phase and interfacial structure on thermal transport in BN/diamond heterostructures</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/2/021107/3380957/Effect-of-phase-and-interfacial-structure-on</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Cubic BN (c-BN) is attractive for high-power and extreme-environment electronics.

We combine time-domain thermoreflectance and time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements to determine the effect phase composition, bond disorder, and interfacial structure have on thermal transport of BN thin-films grown on boron-doped diamond by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals BN film grown on (001) diamond is turbostratic (t-BN), while the film grown on (111) diamond is c-BN. At 300 K, the t-BN film has a thermal conductivity of 17 ± 2.5 W m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the c-BN film has a graded conductivity that varies between 5 and 20 W m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as a function of depth. The c-BN film’s thermal conductivity is ≈ 40× lower than that of bulk c-BN, indicating that defects limit phonon mean-free-paths to ∼10 nm. The c-BN/diamond interface conductance is ≈300 +/− 140/100 MW m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, about threefold higher than t-BN/diamond.

Abstract: Plastic flow in body-centered cubic (BCC) metals and dilute/concentrated alloys is governed by the motion of &lt;111&gt; screw dislocations, whose glide is often impeded by cross-kinks (jogs). While existing strengthening models typically treat depinning as defect-assisted cutting or dislocation bowing, the combined strain-rate and dislocation-line-length dependence of cross-kink stability and effective obstacle spacing remains insufficiently resolved at the atomistic scale. Here, we combine conventional molecular dynamics and strain-boost hyperdynamics to investigate screw-dislocation glide in pure Nb and Mo, dilute Nb-Mo alloys, and equiatomic NbMo at 300 K over strain rates from 10^3 to 10^7 s^-1 and dislocation line lengths from 15 to 50 nm. We first demonstrate that low-strain-rate simulations require sufficiently long dislocation lines to capture consistent cross-kink behavior and strength-determining pinning events. Using the 50~nm configurations, we show that cross-kinks form not only in concentrated alloys but also in pure BCC metals, with their stability governed by the relative rates of kink nucleation and migration on primary and cross-slip planes, which differ between Nb- and Mo-rich systems due to distinct core structures and non-Schmid responses. At high strain rates, depinning proceeds predominantly via vacancy-interstitial cluster formation. In contrast, at low strain rates and long line lengths, alternative pathways emerge, including lateral cross-kink migration, three-dimensional forward--backward cross-slip, and prismatic loop formation. The effective obstacle spacing controlling the critical resolved shear stress therefore emerges from coupled thermodynamic roughening and kinetic evolution. These findings highlight the intrinsically rate-, length-, and chemistry-dependent nature of screw-dislocation strengthening in BCC alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16883v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Finite-size effects and energy alignment in molecular XANES under periodic boundary conditions: A systematic comparison of core-hole treatments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17020</link><description>arXiv:2602.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) provides element-specific insight into local electronic and structural environments, but quantitative interpretation of molecular XANES under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) remains challenging due to finite-size effects and core-hole treatments. In this work, we systematically investigate how core-hole approximations and charge compensation schemes affect transition energies, energy alignment, and chemical-shift reproducibility in PBC-DFT-based molecular XANES calculations. Using ethane as a model system, we show that the full core-hole (FCH) approach exhibits pronounced supercell-size dependence originating from interactions between background charge and charged molecules, with transition energies largely changed by leading-order finite-size terms. In contrast, the excited core-hole (XCH) method rapidly converges owing to its neutral final state. We further demonstrate that most finite-size effects in FCH can be removed by Makov-Payne corrections based on multipole expansion of the electrostatic energy of charged supercells under PBC. Furthermore, we propose a simple Fermi-level-based energy correction (EF/2) that provides comparable improvement using only a single supercell. Extending the analysis to an n-alkane series reveals that while intrinsic electronic-structure changes govern peak shifts for small molecules, systematic energy drifts persist in FCH for larger molecules, whereas XCH and FCH+EF/2 remain stable. Finally, for small molecules at the C and N K-edges, XCH and FCH+EF/2 accurately reproduce experimental chemical shifts, whereas uncorrected FCH fails. These results provide practical guidelines for reliable energy alignment and chemical-shift analysis in molecular XANES under PBC, supporting robust applications to molecular, adsorption, and interfacial systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stockmayer Fluid with a Shifted Dipole: Bulk Behavior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17026</link><description>arXiv:2602.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shifting the point dipole from the center of a Stockmayer particle is a simple geometric modification that has been explored previously, yet its implications for liquid structure, dielectric response, and phase behavior remain incompletely understood. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with analytical theory to provide a unified physical interpretation of how dipole displacement reshapes microscopic correlations and propagates to macroscopic thermodynamic properties. We show that dipole shifting breaks the fore-aft symmetry of the local electrostatic field, producing only modest changes in radial packing but strong alterations in angular structure within the first solvation shell. Enhanced alignment near the dipole head is accompanied by frustrated orientational correlations near the tail, leading to broader angular distributions and a shift away from axial configurations at strong coupling. These structural asymmetries weaken cooperative ordering and result in a systematic reduction of the dielectric constant, despite locally stronger interactions. For large shifts, the dielectric response approaches the Debye limit, indicating effective suppression of dipole-dipole correlations. The same geometric frustration governs vapor-liquid equilibria: while increasing dipole strength raises the critical temperature, even modest shifts disrupt the highly polarized liquid states that emerge at strong coupling and can suppress ferroelectric-like ordering. Predictions from a reparameterized COFFEE theory capture these trends within its domain of validity, highlighting the direct connection between local orientational structure and macroscopic observables. Overall, this work demonstrates that dipole location, not only magnitude, provides a powerful control parameter in dipolar fluids and offers a clear framework for understanding geometric frustration in electrostatic liquids.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Elucidating Na$_2$KSb band structure: near-band-gap photoemission spectroscopy and DFT calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17105</link><description>arXiv:2602.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of Na$_{2}$KSb was studied by a combination of low-energy photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The optical and photoemission quantum efficiency (QE) spectra, along with longitudinal energy distribution curves (EDCs) of multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes were measured in the temperature range of 80--295 K. The thresholds of various band-to-band transition in Na$_{2}$KSb were observed in the optical and QE spectra of Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes. The evolution of EDC derivatives with varying photon energy reveals a fine structure related to the emission of two types of electrons: (i) ballistic electrons, which are excited from heavy hole, light hole and split-off valence bands, and (ii) photoelectrons, that are captured in the side valleys of Na$_{2}$KSb conduction band. The analysis of EDCs and QE spectra allowed us to determine the band structure parameters of Na$_{2}$KSb at $T = 80$ K, including the band gap $E_{\text{g}} = 1.52 \pm 0.02$ eV, spin-orbit splitting $\Delta_{\text{SO}} = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ eV and the energy separations between $\Gamma$ and side valleys of the conduction band: $\Delta_{\Gamma-\text{X}1} = 0.41 \pm 0.05$ eV and $\Delta_{\Gamma-\text{X}2} = 0.65 \pm 0.05$ eV. The experimentally determined band gaps and side valley positions, as well as the energies of the final electronic states of optical transitions are in good agreement with the DFT calculations. The obtained data on the hot electron dynamics and electronic band structure of Na$_{2}$KSb are crucial to improve the understanding of the photoemission processes in this material and will contribute to the development of the robust spin-polarized electron sources with multialkali photocathodes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17105v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Low-Field Ferroelectric Switching realised by Forced Harmonic Oscillation of Domain Walls</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17266</link><description>arXiv:2602.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, dc fields are used for switching dipole orientations in ferroelectrics. Such fields tilt the potential surface experienced by domain walls and thereby lower activation energies for their movement: escape from tilted potential wells is then realised by thermal excitation, allowing a "creep" process of pinning and depinning to develop. Borrowing ideas of domain wall resonance from the magnetic racetrack community, we show that ac fields, applied at the right frequency, can cause switching at much lower field magnitudes than dc ones (by factors of 4-5). Ferroelectric wall motion appears to be overdamped in the system studied (relaxor strontium barium niobate) and so the maximum in switching efficacy observed, at ~100 kHz, cannot be associated with resonant amplification, which needs an underdamped environment. Instead, in this high viscosity system, the frequency at which the maximum switching efficacy occurs seems to represent a compromise between the attempt frequency for wall depinning (which increases with frequency) and the extent to which energy is transferred to the wall within each field cycle (which decreases with frequency). Notwithstanding the absence of true resonance, the observation that ac excitation can dramatically reduce the bias levels needed for ferroelectric switching could still have significant ramifications for low energy memory technology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling Photoluminescence Signatures of Magneto-Optical Coupling in Layered Hybrid Manganese Chloride Perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17324</link><description>arXiv:2602.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between magnetic ordering and light emission is crucial for developing magneto-optical technologies. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the N\'eel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Surface Imaging of bulk Epitaxial CsPbBr3 Perovskite Single Crystals on Mica using Light Assisted Scanning Tunneling Microscopy at Low-Temperature (80 K)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17388</link><description>arXiv:2602.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial single-crystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films on mica, prepared ex-situ, are explored using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by probing the unoccupied electronic states of their surface in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 80 K. Light-assisted STM measurements under a broadband illumination with visible light were employed to enhance and stabilize surface conductivity. STM imaging across the surface of macroscopic bulk CsPbBr3 films reveals large flat terraces characterized by a specific type of surface reconstruction, consisting of parallel rows of U-shaped atomic nanostructures. These structures are spaced by 12 angstroms and exhibit an internal periodicity of 5.1 angstroms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a competition between different orthorhombic CsPbBr3(110) surface reconstructions: a Cs-rich structure, identified as the most energetically stable, and three alternative PbBr rich reconstructions, which are slightly higher in energy yet remain consistent with the STM data. Additional analyses that explicitly account for the mica substrate exclude the cubic CsPbBr3 phase and other orthorhombic surface orientations, while showing that variations in the mica surface termination do not alter the preferred CsPbBr3(110) reconstruction. This combined approach thereby confirms our assignment and resolves previous STM interpretations of CsPbBr3.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Measuring spectral functions of doped magnets with Rydberg tweezer arrays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17600</link><description>arXiv:2602.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements of single-particle spectral functions provide crucial insight into strongly correlated quantum matter by resolving the energy and spatial structure of elementary excitations. Here we introduce a spectroscopic protocol for single-charge injection with simultaneous spatial and energy resolution in a Rydberg tweezer array, effectively emulating scanning tunneling microscopy. By combining this protocol with single-atom-resolved imaging, we go beyond conventional spectroscopy by not only measuring the single-particle spectral function but also directly imaging the microscopic structure of the excitations underlying spectral resonances in frustrated $tJ$ Hamiltonians. We reveal resonances associated with the formation of bound magnetic polarons -- composite quasiparticles consisting of a mobile hole bound to a magnon -- and directly extract their binding energy, spatial extent, and spin character. Finally, by exploiting the spatial tunability of our platform, we measure the local density of states across different lattice geometries. Our work establishes Rydberg tweezer arrays as a powerful platform for spectroscopic studies of strongly correlated models, offering microscopic control and direct real-space access to emergent quasiparticles in engineered quantum matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entropic Barriers and the Kinetic Suppression of Topological Defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16777</link><description>arXiv:2602.16777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many quantum phases, from topological orders to superfluids, are destabilized at finite temperature by the proliferation and motion of topological defects such as anyons or vortices. Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vapor-solid-solid growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24644</link><description>arXiv:2512.24644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising for nanoscale electronics and photonics, but practical deployment requires chirality control. Most catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) growth of SWCNTs proceeds on liquid metal nanoparticles via a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism and yields broad chirality distributions, whereas improved selectivity has been reported for high-melting-point crystalline catalysts, suggesting vapor-solid-solid (VSS) growth. However, the atomistic mechanism and kinetic of VSS SWCNT growth remain unclear. Here it is shown, using machine-learning interatomic potential-driven molecular dynamics on rhenium nanoparticles, that VSS growth is diffusion-limited and governed by facet-dependent surface carbon transport coupled to carbon-driven facet reconfiguration without catalyst melting. Surface diffusion is up to $\sim 50\times$ slower than carbon diffusion in liquid iron, imposing a strict upper bound on sustainable carbon supply and producing a narrow growth window: insufficient transport drives carbon accumulation and multiple nucleation, whereas higher temperatures favor graphitic encapsulation. In contrast to defect-free VLS growth, defects persist, indicating slow defect healing, and equilibrium simulations reveal suppressed edge configurational entropy with stabilization of zigzag-rich, Klein-decorated edges. Together, these results establish facet evolution and surface diffusion as joint regulators of diffusion-limited VSS growth and motivate stringent control of temperature and carbon supply.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24644v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Biaxial Strain Control of Helimagnetism via Chemical Expansion in Thin Film SrFeO3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10372</link><description>arXiv:2602.10372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate control of helimagnetic order in biaxially strained SrFeO3 thin films using neutron diffraction and resonant soft x-ray scattering. SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10372v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deciphering Majorana Zero Modes in Topological Superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 with Machine-Learning-Assisted Spectral Deconvolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15178</link><description>arXiv:2602.15178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors (TSCs) remains a challenge due to complex in-gap states that can also produce zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBPs). Here we demonstrate a data-driven workflow that integrates pixel-wise spectral deconvolution with machine-learning (ML) to analyze tunneling spectroscopy from FeTe0.55Se0.45, an intrinsic TSC. Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis to disentangle genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15178v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link><description>arXiv:2509.19877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19877v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link><description>arXiv:2602.12085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic Modeling of Anisotropic Strength Surfaces from Atomistic Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16007</link><description>arXiv:2602.16007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a unified framework for inferring, representing, and statistically characterizing an anisotropic strength surface directly from molecular dynamics data. Large-scale tensile loading simulations are used to generate failure data across all principal stress ratios and loading orientations, facilitated by a data-driven mapping between imposed strain-rate tensors and resulting stresses. The orientation-dependent strength surface is then represented using a constrained parametric formulation in which the surface parameters vary smoothly with loading angle through a low-dimensional functional encoding. To deploy the framework, we specifically consider the case of monocrystalline graphene, which is a prototypical two-dimensional material that has been extensively characterized, both experimentally and computationally, in the literature. For defective graphene, multiple random realizations of vacancy defect distributions are used to construct a stochastic ensemble of angular strength surfaces. Because each anisotropic strength surface requires substantial atomistic sampling to construct, the resulting ensemble is inherently limited in size, motivating the use of compact encoding, dimensionality reduction, and probabilistic modeling to characterize strength variability. Dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis reveals a condensed latent representation of the fitted, encoded surfaces, where a Gaussian mixture model is employed to capture defect-induced variability, including rare outlier behaviors arising from clustered vacancy defects. Sampling from this probabilistic model enables the generation of new, physically admissible strength surfaces and the construction of confidence intervals in both parameter space and stress space.

Abstract: Explorative chemistry in a reaction system composed of NbI4, Li2(CN2), and Li2O has led to the discovery of a number of niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds. During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16011v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Twist-induced Out-of-plane Ferroelectricity in Bilayer Hafnia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16051</link><description>arXiv:2602.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO2 is a promising candidate for next-generation memory devices due to its CMOS compatibility and ability to retain polarization at nanometer scales. However, the polar orthorhombic phase (Pca2_1) responsible for ferroelectricity is metastable and requires extrinsic stabilization, which makes it challenging for integration with silicon. We predict that bilayer 1T-HfO2 can exhibit robust and switchable out-of-plane (OOP) polarization arising from stacking-induced symmetry breaking. Using first-principles density functional theory, we predict that monolayer 1T-HfO2 can be cleaved from the (111) surface of cubic hafnia, and the monolayer is dynamically stable. When two aligned monolayers are twisted to form a moir\'e superlattice, it breaks the interlayer symmetry and allows the emergence of bistable OOP polarization. At a twist angle of 7.34o, the system exhibits a net polarization of ~16 {\mu}C/cm2. This sizeable polarization is due to the large polar displacements concentrated in AB stacking domains. Importantly, this polarization can be reversibly switched via interlayer sliding with a low energy barrier (~8 meV/formula unit) and comparable low coercive field (~0.2 V/nm), offering electric-field tunability. These findings establish twisted bilayer 1T-HfO2 as a scalable and robust 2D ferroelectric platform, enabling new pathways for integrating ferroelectric functionality into atomically thin memory and logic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation-ledge coupling drives non-conservative migration of semicoherent precipitate interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16158</link><description>arXiv:2602.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitate shape and size control the strength and stability of many structural alloys, yet the microscopic mechanism by which semicoherent precipitate interfaces migrate remains unclear. In particular, how dense interfacial dislocation networks move while accommodating transformation strain has resisted direct, time-resolved characterization. Here, we show that non-conservative motion of interfacial dislocations is intrinsically coupled to the nucleation and lateral propagation of nanoscale growth ledges, providing a defect-based kinetic description of lath growth. Phase-field-crystal simulations of a prototypical face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) transformation resolve strongly anisotropic interface kinetics: the end face advances continuously along the lath long axis, whereas facets thicken by discrete ledge sweeps accompanied by mixed glide-climb reactions in a closed dislocation network. Crystallographic analyses predict the dislocation arrangements, rationalize the anisotropy via the geometry of misfit localization, and show how dislocation motion accommodates the transformation strain. In situ transmission electron microscopy of austenite precipitates in duplex stainless steel captures rapid ledge propagation on habit planes, consistent with the predicted migration mode. Our results bridge point-defect transport, dislocation reactions, and interface mobility, enabling quantitative, transferable predictions of precipitate morphology evolution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entanglement negativity in decohered topological states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16597</link><description>arXiv:2602.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16597v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Growth and crystallographic structure of TiTe$_2$ on Au(111): From sub-monolayer structures to single- and multi-layer films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16647</link><description>arXiv:2602.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the initial growth of TiTe$_2$ on Au(111) from sub-monolayer to multi-layer coverage by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction intensity analysis (LEED-IV), and density functional theory (DFT). In the submonolayer regime we find a stable and well-ordered $(5\times\sqrt{3})_{\mathrm{rect}}$ superstructure consisting of separated TiTe$_2$ molecules, whereby the Ti atoms substitute Au atoms of the first substrate layer as proven by LEED-IV. By adding further Ti and Te in a 1:2 ratio and proper annealing dealloying sets in and a homogeneous 1T-TiTe$_2$ monolayer film on an unreconstructed substrate is formed. The resulting moir\'e structure is close to a $(4 \times 4)$ superstructure w.r.t. Au(111) and has a slightly expanded in-plane lattice parameter compared to the 1T-TiTe$_2$ bulk value. With further stoichiometric deposition, thicker 1T-TiTe$_2$ films grow. Surprisingly, a five layer thick film exhibits an even larger lattice-parameter (1.5 % larger than the bulk value). All LEED-IV analyses are based on best-fit R-factors of $R \le 0.13$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Design Principles for Fluid Molecular Ferroelectrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16649</link><description>arXiv:2602.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid molecular ferroelectrics are a new class of organic materials where ferroelectricity is found in conjunction with 3D fluidity whilst still retaining spontaneous polarization values comparable to their traditional solid state counterparts. One of the major challenges for soft condensed matter physics is predicting whether a fluid molecular material will form ferroelectric phase with nematic or smectic order. Through the synthesis of forty five systematically varied molecules, and by analogy to solid molecular ferroelectrics, is it shown that subtle hydrogen fluorine substitution allows for tuneable syn-parallel pairing motifs resulting in either specific pairings leading too geometrically constrained lamellar order or diversified pairings stabilising nematic ordering. Large-scale, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that smectic ferroelectricity emerges from discrete lateral pairing modes, whereas nematic phases arise from a multiplicity of equivalent polar configurations. Together, these findings establish experimentally validated design principles for fluid molecular ferroelectrics and provide a predictive framework for engineering functional polar fluids.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16649v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Factorization Machine with Quadratic-Optimization Annealing for RNA Inverse Folding and Evaluation of Binary-Integer Encoding and Nucleotide Assignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16643</link><description>arXiv:2602.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16643v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry and Majorana strong zero modes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link><description>arXiv:2412.06377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. Finally, we develop quantum circuit realizations of our model paving the way towards the creation of exact Majorana strong zero modes with digital quantum hardware.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.06377v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural and chemical disorder in Ni$_2$MnGa Heusler alloy investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19968</link><description>arXiv:2505.19968v2 Announce Type: replace

The structural analysis confirmed the orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions indicating magnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N1}= 61\,\rm K$ and a spin reorientation at $T_{\rm N2}= 40\,\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes, which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\rm N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study are suggested to show AFM order below $T_{\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher $T_{\rm C1}=78\,\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling constants of the RKKY interaction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26105v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Many-body post-processing of density functional calculations using the variational quantum eigensolver for Bader charge analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12887</link><description>arXiv:2510.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.12887v2</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Synergistic regulation of defects, charge carriers, and ions via bimolecular engineering in carbon-based perovskite photovoltaics</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00479-9?rss=yes</link><description>We report a bimolecular interlayer strategy integrating octylammonium iodide (OAI) and (2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl) phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz) to engineer perovskite surfaces in low-temperature printable carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs).

While conventional ligand engineering strategies rely on ligand exchange processes that include both the removal of native ligands and the introduction of alternative passivating molecules, such approaches often introduce chemical complexity and overlapping effects. In this study, we demonstrate that selectively removing native oleic acid ligands, without introducing new ligands, can effectively enhance device efficiency and operational lifetime. Using trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate as a mild stripping agent, we tuned ligand density in ZnSeTe/ZnSe/ZnS blue quantum dots with controlled treatment concentrations. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed progressive ligand removal, while photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield and time-resolved PL measurements revealed a concomitant increase in surface trap states. Despite the introduction of additional defects, the resulting QD-LEDs exhibited improved performance: the current efficiency increased from 9.0 to 14.4 cd A&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the operational lifetime LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (time to 50% luminance decay) extended from 17.9 to 61.5 h. Single-carrier measurements revealed that although both hole and electron transport decreased following ligand stripping, electron mobility was more strongly suppressed than hole mobility, resulting in improved charge balance. These findings suggest that surface defect formation, often considered detrimental, can instead be leveraged through careful ligand density control as a viable tool for enhancing QD-LED performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/7/073306/3380509/Ligand-stripping-induced-asymmetric-charge</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Quantification of Shallow Defect Suppression in Aminosilane-Passivated Lead Halide Perovskites via Optical and Electrochemical Methods</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03869</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03869/asset/images/medium/nz5c03869_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03869&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:05:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03869</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis] A single catalyst solution: unraveling propane-to-propene conversion over WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts combining DFT and microkinetic modeling study</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726001077?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 17 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Catalysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Monojit Patra, Anirban Bagdi, Abhradeep Kundu, Biplab Rajbanshi&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 12:57:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726001077</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] An Elastocaloric Polymer with Ultra‐High Solid‐State Cooling via Defect Engineering</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202518106?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, Volume 13, Issue 10, 18 February 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 10:53:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202518106</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Altermegnets are a class of metallic magnets characterized by spin-split electron bands. Band splitting in the hexagonal altermagnet CrSb was studied using the ARPES method, magnetotransport and torque measurements, combined with DFT+U calculations. The shape, position, and even symmetry of the Fermi surfaces found in these studies vary. The developed approach, based on symmetry considerations, allows us to establish several general properties of band splitting in the altermagnet CrSb, including the symmetry of the spin distribution in each electron band, the symmetry of the bands in an external magnetic field, and the dependence of the frequencies and amplitudes of quantum oscillations on the magnetic field.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deciphering Majorana Zero Modes in Topological Superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 with Machine-Learning-Assisted Spectral Deconvolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15178</link><description>arXiv:2602.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors (TSC) remains a challenge due to complex in-gap states that can also produce zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBPs). Here we demonstrate a data-driven workflow that integrates pixel-wise spectral deconvolution with machine-learning (ML) to analyze tunneling spectroscopy from FeTe0.55Se0.45, an intrinsic TSC. Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunnelling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis in disentangling genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow paves the way to further manipulating MZMs in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in layered trimer iridate Ba4Ir3 O10 : the density functional approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15444</link><description>arXiv:2602.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of Ba4Ir3O10 within the density-functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations (GGA+U) in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum possesses several sharp features below 2.1 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitation located from 2.1 to 4.6 eV is due to t2g to eg and O2p to t2g transitions. The wide structure situated at 6.2-12 eV appears due to charge transfer and O2p to eg transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reactive Coarse Grained Force Field for Metal-Organic Frameworks applied to Modeling ZIF-8 Self-Assembly</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15534</link><description>arXiv:2602.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the self-assembly mechanism of metal-organic frameworks is a crucial step in reducing trial-and-error tests in their synthesis protocols. Atomistic simulations have proven essential in revealing molecular-level features of MOF nucleation, but they still exhibit limitations in the simulation setups due to size constraints (inability of reaching realistic concentrations or exploring non-stoichiometric metal:ligand ratios). In this contribution, we develop a methodology to derive reactive coarse grained force fields based on multiscale coarse graining methods. We apply our novel methodology to the case of the archetypal zeolitic-imidazolate framework ZIF-8. Our coarse grained force field, which we call nb-CG-ZIF-FF, does not contain any explicit connectivity information, but learns the tetrahedral Zn-connectivity from many body correlations within an atomistic benchmark. nb-CG-ZIF-FF quantitatively reproduces the features of bulk, crystalline ZIF-8 as well as the structural evolution of pre-nucleation species in terms of Zn n-fold coordination populations from the atomistic benchmark. While the range of rings that are formed along the synthesis process are well captured by nb-CG-ZIF-FF, the model cannot exactly reproduce ring populations. Our reactive CG force field fitting approach can be applied to any MOF, opening new research avenues in modeling MOF formation, decomposition, defect dynamics and phase transition processes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15534v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Origin of a shallow electron pocket: $\beta$-band in Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ studied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15588</link><description>arXiv:2602.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the electronic structure of Co-intercalated 2H-TaS$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In the compound Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, the main electronic bands closely resemble those of pristine 2H-TaS$_2$, with no clear signs of band folding. However, a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the $\beta$-feature, was detected at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. The surface vs bulk origin of this feature is debated, as it cannot be reproduced using standard DFT calculations. To resolve this, we employed cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to incorporating an exact treatment of strong electron correlations (U) on the cobalt sites, going beyond DFT+U approximation. To further substantiate this, we studied an underdoped sample, Co$_{0.22}$TaS$_2$, where a reduced charge transfer leads to different Co orbital character near the Fermi level. We find that its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS$_2$, and crucially, lacks the $\beta$-feature. Our results demonstrate that the $\beta$-feature is of the bulk origin emerging from the strong electronic correlations where both the Co charge state and long-range crystallographic order play an important role. This work highlights the need for accurate treatment of electron correlations when studying intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Neel temperature and helical spin order of altermagnetic RuO2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15606</link><description>arXiv:2602.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic groundstate of RuO$_2$ remains controversial, with experimental evidence for a nonmagnetic groundstate of ideal bulk material and indications of a magnetic state in strained thin films. Here, I investigate the N\'eel temperature of the (hypothetical) altermagnetic state of bulk RuO$_2$, stabilized via the DFT$+U$ technique, by mapping on a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The N\'eel temperature scales monotonously with the magnetic moment up to the point where a large $+U$ term opens a band gap and turns RuO$_2$ semiconducting. The maximum N\'eel temperature obtained by this procedure is 408\,K at $U=3$\,eV, and much smaller values for smaller $U$. A reciprocal-space eigenvalue analysis reveals a helimagnetic groundstate of the spin model due to intra-sublattice antiferromagnetic coupling. This situation resembles the isostructural $\beta$-MnO$_2$, which is a prototype helimagnet. Further comparison with calculations on CrO$_2$ and altermagnetic MnF$_2$ taking $U$ as an adjustable parameter supports the validity of the spin model analysis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15606v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized local potential functional embedding theory of localized orbitals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15624</link><description>arXiv:2602.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a generalized flavor, in the sense of generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory (gKS-DFT), of the recently derived local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET) [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 20, 10293], where the in-principle exact formalism of DFT is combined with that of density matrix embedding theory (DMET). In generalized LPFET (gLPFET), the embedding clusters are designed from a full-size gKS system where the (in-principle non-local) Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local (in the localized orbital representation) correlation potential. The latter is optimized self-consistently such that gKS and local embedding cluster's densities match. Unlike in DMET, which uses the same (global) chemical potential value in all clusters, each embedded orbital has its own chemical potential in gLPFET. We show analytically that, when electron correlation is strongly local, the latter potential becomes a simple functional of the correlation potential. Numerical calculations on model systems confirm the high accuracy of gLPFET in this regime, in contrast to DMET. Moreover, we show that gLPFET completely fixes the flaw of LPFET in weaker correlation regimes, through its appropriate description of the Hartree-exchange potential.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15624v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Three-Dimensional Optical-Electrical Simulation of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15759</link><description>arXiv:2602.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in lead-free perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a balance among environmental safety and high optoelectronic performance remains challenging. The inorganic double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its robust three-dimensional crystal structure and suitable visible-range bandgap. However, best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported so far - 6.37% experimentally and 27.78% in numerical studies - remain below the theoretical performance potential, largely due to suboptimal charge transport layers, and interface-related recombination losses. Here, we address this gap using a 3D finite-element method (FEM) implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, which couples optical simulations with semiconductor drift-diffusion transport. To our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive 3D FEM-based study of a double halide perovskite solar cell. Screening of 25 electron transport layer (ETL)-hole transport layer (HTL) combinations identifies CeO2 and P3HT as the optimal ETL and HTL respectively. Device performance is further analyzed through systematic variation of layer thicknesses, doping concentrations and defect densities within the FTO/CeO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/Au architecture. Under optimized parameters, the simulated device achieves a PCE of 31.76%, representing the theoretical upper bound predicted by the model.

Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection operation with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. In an open geometry of the studied model, we identify two regimes that exhibit different degeneracy patterns. We discuss whether this is a manifestation of distinct fermion symmetry-protected topological orders protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.06377v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17558</link><description>arXiv:2504.17558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial dimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the quasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles, consistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity affects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation function. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all distances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from 0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz predicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been shown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails even qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the thermodynamic limit.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17558v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25423</link><description>arXiv:2509.25423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25423v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link><description>arXiv:2602.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07110v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link><description>arXiv:2602.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12085v2</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: InfoMat: Table of Contents] Emerging single‐element ferroelectrics: From theory to experiment</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/inf2.70125?af=R</link><description>InfoMat, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: InfoMat: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 04:01:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/inf2.70125</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] High Open-Circuit Voltage–Fill factor product in perovskite solar cells enabled by ferroelectric heterojunction modulation</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69391-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 18 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69391-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69391-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Wu et al. report a strategy of incorporating either Dion-Jacobson phase or Ruddlesden-Popper phase ferroelectric perovskite with FAPbI3 to form bulk heterojunctions, increasing the open-circuit voltage-fill factor product and enabling single junction solar cells with an efficiency of 26.62%.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69391-3</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Hemocyte-secreted Papilin bearing mucin-type O-glycans regulates peripodial stalk formation via epidermal JAK/STAT signaling in Drosophila</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00429-3?rss=yes</link><description>Protein glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification.

These advancements address the limitations of conventional von Neumann architectures. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have become important candidate materials for synaptic devices due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, and the trapping effect of defects in TMDs on photogenerated carriers enables this possibility. However, current synaptic devices based on TMDs face the challenges associated with unstable defect effects, relying on complex heterojunctions and device structures to achieve neural synapse function, which limits their widespread application. In this work, the alloying strategy of TMDs is adopted to address this issue.

Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate velocity-dependent directional friction on a surface structured with tilted (~57{\deg}) titania nanorods using standard and colloidal probe force microscopy. Friction is measured at four different sliding speeds in two configurations, along and opposite to the tilt and perpendicular to the tilt direction, exhibiting anisotropic friction. Furthermore, friction decreases logarithmically with increasing sliding speed, which is attributed to the viscoelastic bending of the nanorods caused by stress-induced defect migration. The velocity weakening is more pronounced in the direction perpendicular to the tilt than along and opposite to it. The experimental findings are corroborated by creep measurements, which are well-reproduced by the Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model of viscoelasticity. Our results may be applied to the development of direction- and velocity-dependent sensors for microscale sliding motion as a robust alternative to structured interfaces based on polymeric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13343v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Optoelectronic Properties and Photoelectrochemical Performance of \b{eta}-TaON via Vanadium Doping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13365</link><description>arXiv:2602.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of beta-TaON for solar-driven water splitting is hindered by limitations in phase purity, stoichiometry, crystallinity, visible-light absorption, carrier mobility, and high recombination rates. This study investigates the impact of vanadium doping (0-25 at.% V) on the structural, optoelectronic, and photoelectrochemical properties of beta-TaON using both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) approaches. Phase-pure beta-TaON is retained up to 10 at.% V, beyond which secondary phases (Ta2O5 and VN) form, indicating a threshold of ~10 at.% under the applied synthesis conditions. All samples exhibit a porous microstructure. Increasing vanadium content induces a redshift in the absorption edge, reducing the bandgap from 2.72 eV (undoped) to 2.38 eV at 25 at.% V for the main beta-TaON phase, in agreement with DFT results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms substitutional incorporation of V5+ for Ta5+ in the beta-TaON lattice. DFT calculations reveal reduced electron effective mass, enhanced n-type conductivity, and favorable band edge shifts enabling spontaneous overall water splitting at &lt;=10 at.% V. Photoelectrochemical measurements show improved photocurrent and more negative onset potentials for 5-10 at.% V, while higher V doping degrades performance due to phase segregation, which likely increases recombination and hinders interfacial charge transport. Vanadium doping (&lt;=10 at.% V) is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic structure and enhancing the optical properties and photoelectrochemical performance of beta-TaON.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Room Temperature RF Sputtering of Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductor Nd2Ni0.8Cu0.2O4+d films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13366</link><description>arXiv:2602.13366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lowering the operating temperature of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) is essential for improving durability and enabling large scale commercialization. Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, such as Nd$2$Ni${1-x}$Cu$x$O${4+\delta}$ (NNCO), offer attractive cathode properties due to their high oxygen transport and favourable defect chemistry. In this work, we investigate the fabrication of Nd$2$Ni${0.8}$Cu${0.2}$O${4+\delta}$ thin films using a room temperature RF sputtering process followed by moderate temperature annealing. To simplify deposition, a single stoichiometric target was employed, despite the compositional challenges posed by elements with different sputtering yields. We examine the effect of sputtering power density on phase formation and film stoichiometry through X-ray diffraction, Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and temperature dependent resistivity measurements. Increasing the sputtering power density strongly reduces the presence of spurious phases and promotes stabilization of the desired n=1 Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Films deposited at 230 W (3.1 W cm$^{-2}$) exhibit a predominant NNCO structure, elemental ratios close to nominal composition, and resistivity values consistent with bulk materials. These findings demonstrate that high power sputtering combined with ex situ annealing enables the production of NNCO thin films suitable for SOFC cathodes. The results support the potential of PVD based approaches for scalable fabrication of advanced SOFC components.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13366v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Trion transfer in mixed-dimensional heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13490</link><description>arXiv:2602.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged excitons, or trions, offering unique spin and charge degrees of freedom, have primarily been investigated in doped systems where charges are long considered indispensable. Here, we present an alternative route to ultra-efficient trion emission from an intrinsic, defect-free semiconductor via a transfer mechanism. By exciting trions in two-dimensional tungsten-diselenide donors and transferring them into one-dimensional carbon-nanotube acceptors in mixed-dimensional heterostructures, we circumvent the usual carrier requirement, overcoming intrinsic Auger-quenching limitations. Benefitting from a reservoir effect induced by dimensional heterogeneity, this process achieves trion emission efficiencies increased by over 100-fold compared to conventional doping-based approaches, and remains robust across diverse doping conditions. Our findings extend the exciton transfer paradigm to the three-body quasiparticles, offering a new platform for advancing excitonic physics and trion-based optoelectronic/spintronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13490v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Disorder on Exciton Transfer in a Quantum Dot Chain with Short-Range Interaction and a Side-Coupled Defect</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13828</link><description>arXiv:2602.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the propagation of excitons in linear chains of QDs with a side defect, located on a dielectric substrate. This configuration is suitable for spatially selective excitation of the system by pulsed optical radiation through the side defect. The dynamics of excitation in the chain is governed by structural disorder, caused by technological variations in the parameters of the QDs themselves and their mutual arrangement. To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse. It is shown that dynamic localization emerging in the system corresponds to the stationary localization properties of the states of the chain with a side defect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unified Phase-Field Framework for Antiferroelectric, Ferroelectric and Dielectric Phases: Application to HZO Thin Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13959</link><description>arXiv:2602.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystalline hafnia-based thin films exhibit mixed ferroelectric (FE), antiferroelectric (AFE), and dielectric (DE) behavior, with switching characteristics strongly influenced by microstructure and phase distribution. Here, we develop a unified grain-resolved three-dimensional phase-field framework for metal-insulator-metal capacitors that simultaneously captures ferroic phase characteristics in realistic polycrystalline microstructures by explicitly incorporating grain topology and crystallographic orientation. Antipolar sublattice kinetics are represented via the coupled evolution of macroscopic and staggered polarization order parameters. All thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calibrated to experimental P-E hysteresis loops and held fixed across all simulations. The results show that phase fractions primarily determine hysteresis character, while vertical segregation of AFE- and FE-rich regions systematically reduces the effective coercive field (Ec) under identical electrical loading. Grain-resolved analysis reveals that this reduction arises from microstructure-assisted switching pathways and electrostatic coupling between layers. These findings demonstrate that vertical phase arrangement provides a viable strategy to engineer switching behavior in hafnia-based ferroic capacitors and highlight the importance of explicit microstructural resolution for quantitative phase-field modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Delocalisation explains efficient transport and charge generation in neat Y6 organic photovoltaics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14097</link><description>arXiv:2602.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-fullerene acceptors (NFA), such as Y6, have significantly improved the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). However, the fundamental processes behind the high efficiencies of NFA devices have remained incompletely understood, with the high efficiencies persisting without the large energetic offsets often thought to be required for charge separation. Even more surprising has been the efficient charge generation in neat Y6 devices, where there is no energetic offset at all. Here, we simulate charge transport and separation in Y6 using delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC) parameterised using atomistic calculations, thus taking into account the often-neglected ingredients of delocalisation, disorder, and polaron formation. Including delocalisation predicts higher carrier mobilities and exciton diffusion coefficients than is possible with classical simulations, bringing them into agreement with experimental values. Delocalisation also predicts higher charge-generation efficiencies in neat Y6, in agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, this work establishes dKMC as a realistic, predictive tool for understanding next-generation OPVs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic skyrmion lattice disclinations in pentagon- and heptagon-shaped FeGe crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14155</link><description>arXiv:2602.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in chiral magnets typically arrange into hexagonal lattices, with their structural order influenced by factors such as temperature, external magnetic fields and geometric constraints. While translational defects in skyrmion lattices such as dislocations have been extensively studied, individual angular defects, or disclinations, remain largely unexplored.

Abstract: Controlled disorder in correlated materials provides a new route to emergent stochastic dynamics in neuromorphic hardware. Here we show that focused ion beam irradiation in VO$_{2}$- and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based resistive-switching oscillators induces a transition from regular periodic oscillations to strongly irregular stochastic firing, while simultaneously reducing the required switching energy by orders of magnitude. Under an applied electric field, these materials undergo a volatile insulator-to-metal transition characterized by the formation of percolating metallic filaments within an insulating bulk. Using numerical simulations based on the Mott resistor network, we demonstrate that defect-induced modifications to filament nucleation and stability drive these devices into stochastic oscillatory regimes. These results are validated by experimental measurements on irradiated VO$_{2}$ and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation dynamics on deformable surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14348</link><description>arXiv:2602.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully coupled theoretical description of dislocation dynamics on deformable crystalline surfaces, using continuum modeling and the amplitude-phase-field crystal (APFC) framework extended to curved geometries. We derive a general kinematic expression for dislocation velocity directly from the complex-amplitude evolution equations, which is also applicable to deformed surfaces through curvature-modified differential operators. From numerical simulations, we show that even small out-of-plane deformations reshape the phenomenology of defect motion through curvature-induced self-propulsion, modified glide directions, and non-classical defect-defect interactions. Our results show how surface geometry profoundly influences defect dynamics and establish the surface-APFC model as a powerful framework for predicting and interpreting curvature-defect coupling across a wide range of systems, from stiff but deformable layers to soft matter surfaces and membranes that retain crystalline order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14348v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] M-CODE: Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14384</link><description>arXiv:2602.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in materials science requires data standards and data management practices that can capture the complexity of real-world structures, including surfaces, interfaces, defects, and dimensionality reduction. We present M-CODE - Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution - a compact categorization system that links materials-science-specific terminology to a set of reusable concepts as building blocks and provenance-aware transformations. M-CODE classifies structures by dimensionality, structural complexity (from pristine to compound pristine, defective, and processed), and variants that capture common structure creation and evolution approaches. A practical implementation of the categorization is provided in an open-source codebase that includes JSON schemas, examples, and Python and TypeScript types/interfaces, designed to support reproducible dataset generation, validation, and community contributions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Convergent-Beam X-ray Crystallography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14402</link><description>arXiv:2602.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DFT and MLIP study of solute segregation to coherent and semi-coherent {\alpha}-Fe/Fe$_3$C interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14603</link><description>arXiv:2602.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute segregation to interfaces significantly impacts material behavior. A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $\alpha$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

Abstract: Point defects in silicon carbide (SiC), particularly the negatively-charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$) in 4H-SiC, are leading candidates for scalable quantum technologies due to their favorable spin-optical properties and compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication processes. Comprehensive knowledge of a defect's electronic structure is essential for interpreting spin-optical dynamics and for the reliable design and optimization of defect-based quantum devices. Despite extensive study, our knowledge of the electronic structure of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ is limited since key excited-state manifolds have remained inaccessible to conventional steady-state spectroscopy. In this study, transient absorption spectroscopy is utilized to probe non-equilibrium electronic transitions of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ and to uncover previously unobserved excited states. The first direct observation of the elusive V2' quartet transition is presented, with its broad spectral signature attributed to nonadiabatic vibronic coupling. Within the spin-doublet manifold, which is central to optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) but has remained unresolved spectroscopically, multiple optical transitions are identified. The complete electronic level structure in the relevant energy range is elucidated by combining polarization-resolved spectroscopy, group-theoretical analysis, quantum embedding calculations and first-principles optical lineshape modeling. Collectively, these results provide a microscopic understanding of the $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ electronic structure. Our approach also establishes a general framework for resolving and understanding complex excited-state manifolds in wide-bandgap color centers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14818v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sub-1-Angstrom-Resolution Imaging Reveals Phase Contrast Transition in Ice Ih Caused by Basal Stacking Faults</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14920</link><description>arXiv:2602.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anisotropy-driven interfacial magnetism in Ru-deficient SrRuO$_3$ thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14932</link><description>arXiv:2602.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stoichiometric SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) is a metallic itinerant ferromagnet with relatively homogeneous magnetization, Ru deficiency provides a powerful route to alter its electronic transport and depth-dependent magnetic properties. Ru-deficient SRO thin films grown by radio-frequency high oxygen pressure sputtering were investigated using a combination of X-ray reflectivity, polarized neutron reflectometry, off-specular neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical transport, and magnetometry. Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection. Our results establish Ru deficiency as a key control parameter governing transport, magnetization, and anisotropy in SRO thin films and highlight defect and interface engineering as powerful routes to tailor interfacial magnetism in correlated oxide heterostructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Practical and improved density functionals for computational catalysis on metal surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14962</link><description>arXiv:2602.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been critical towards our current atomistic understanding of catalysis on transition-metal surfaces. It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14962v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface defects in carbon-doped hexagonal boron nitride for negative-contrast direct laser writing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13657</link><description>arXiv:2602.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are active in a broad spectral range from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13657v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect relative entropy in symmetric orbifold CFTs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13782</link><description>arXiv:2602.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the defect relative entropy between topological defects in the symmetric product orbifold CFT $\mathrm{Sym}^N(M) = M^{\otimes N}/S_N$. Our analysis covers two distinct classes of defects: universal defects, which realize the $\mathrm{Rep}(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry, and non-universal defects.
  We show that the defect relative entropy reduces to a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. The resulting expression decomposes naturally into two contributions: one governed by characters of the symmetric group $S_N$, and the other controlled by modular $S$-matrix elements of the seed RCFT. Remarkably, both sets of data appear as probability distributions, yielding an information-theoretic interpretation of permutation group data and modular data within the symmetric orbifold.
  The structure of the divergence depends sensitively on the defect class. For universal defects, only the permutation group data contributes; for maximally fractional defects, both permutation and modular data enter and together define the relevant probability distributions. This feature suggests that the maximally fractional defect can be understood as a kind of product of the RCFT defect and the symmetric orbifold defect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Complex-valued in-medium potential between heavy impurities in ultracold atoms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08241</link><description>arXiv:2312.08241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the induced potential in a finite temperature cold atomic medium between two heavy impurities, or polarons, which is shown to be \textit{complex-valued} in general. The imaginary part of the complex-valued potential describes a decoherence effect, and thus, the resulting Schr\"odinger equation for the two polarons acquires a non-Hermitian term. We apply the developed formulation to two representative cases of polarons interacting with medium particles through the $s$-wave contact interaction: (i) the normal phase of single-component (i.e., spin-polarized) fermions using the fermionic field theory, and (ii) a superfluid phase using the superfluid effective field theory, which is valid either for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a single-component Bose gas or for the BEC-BCS crossover in two-component fermions at a low-energy regime. Computing the leading-order term, the imaginary part of the potential in both cases is found to show a universal $r^{-2}$ behavior at long distance. We propose three experimental ways to observe the effects of the universal imaginary potential in cold atoms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2312.08241v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06914</link><description>arXiv:2504.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal activity can fundamentally reshape the mechanical behavior of solids, yet its role in softening and failure remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids via non-affine fluctuations that quantify local rearrangements relative to global strain. Using scaling analysis and numerical simulations, we show that non-affinity in crystalline solids grows quadratically with active speed, increases linearly with persistence time before saturating, and scales inversely with the distance to the melting density. Spatial correlations reveal an activity-dependent growing correlation length, while relaxation dynamics are governed by the active persistence time. With increasing activity, the distributions of local non-affinity broaden, become more skewed, and develop heavy tails, eventually forming a secondary maximum that signals coexisting small and large non-affinities; this heterogeneity precedes defect formation and two-step melting from solid to hexatic and ultimately to fluid. Finally, we demonstrate that spatially patterned activation provides a simple route to locally induce non-affinity and mechanical softening. Our predictions are experimentally testable and suggest a pathway to tunable mechanics in adaptive metamaterials, with implications for mechanical regulation in biological systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.06914v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- and consequent motion -- in active nematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19665</link><description>arXiv:2504.19665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.19665v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Low-temperature transport in high-conductivity correlated metals: a density-functional plus dynamical mean-field study of cubic perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04508</link><description>arXiv:2505.04508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While methods based on density-functional perturbation theory have dramatically improved our understanding of electron-phonon contributions to transport in materials, methods for accurately capturing electron-electron scattering relevant to low temperatures have seen significantly less development. The case of high-conductivity, moderately correlated materials characterized by low scattering rates is particularly challenging, since exquisite numerical precision of the low-energy electronic structure is required. Recent methodological advancements to density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), including adaptive Brillouin-zone integration and numerically precise self-energies, enable a rigorous investigation of electron-electron scattering in such materials. In particular, these tools may be leveraged to perform a robust scattering-rate analysis on both real- and imaginary-frequency axes. Applying this methodology to a subset of ABO$_3$ perovskite oxides -- SrVO$_3$, SrMoO$_3$, PbMoO$_3$, and SrRuO$_3$ -- we demonstrate its ability to qualitatively and quantitatively describe electron-electron contributions to the temperature-dependent direct-current resistivity. This combination of numerical techniques offers fundamental insight into the role of electronic correlations in transport phenomena and provides a predictive tool for identifying materials with potential for technological applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.04508v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link><description>arXiv:2510.01875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based attenuation of narrow-band fluctuations to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus substantially reducing the burden of computational cost required for XRTS analysis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01875v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin and orbital-to-charge conversion in noncentrosymmetric materials: Hall versus Rashba-Edelstein effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09511</link><description>arXiv:2511.09511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, treating the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect on an equal footing. We develop a general formalism for this interconversion based solely on macroscopic observables. The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09511v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Elastic, Quasielastic, and Superelastic Electron Scattering from Thermal Lattice Distortions in Perfect Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00796</link><description>arXiv:2602.00796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard treatments of electron transport, momentum relaxation in a perfect, defect-free crystal is linked with phonon creation or annihilation. In this work, we reconsider this problem for a finite, isolated crystal, retaining the lattice center-of-mass (recoil) degree of freedom and enforcing conservation of total mechanical momentum together with discrete crystal pseudomomentum. Starting from the density-density form of the electron-lattice interaction, we show that an electron in the interior of a perfect crystal admits elastic momentum-transfer channels in which total momentum is conserved by recoil of the lattice background without phonon excitation. These elastic channels can provide the leading contribution to momentum relaxation. We further identify mixed quasi-elastic and superelastic processes in which phonon occupations change but do not account entirely for the electron's momentum transfer. The elastic channels arise within the standard microscopic Hamiltonian and do not require additional disorder or defects. The resulting framework provides a complementary microscopic perspective on momentum relaxation in clean crystals and is consistent with experimental phenomena such as weak localization, quantum oscillations, ultrasonic attenuation, and the observed separation of momentum and energy relaxation times.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00796v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12053</link><description>arXiv:2602.12053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12053v2</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Room-temperature-grown CsAg 2 I 3  single-crystal microrods for high-performance heterostructured UV photodetection and imaging</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/7/073301/3380152/Room-temperature-grown-CsAg2I3-single-crystal</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Lead-free metal halide perovskites, especially with low-dimensional structures, show great potential in fabricating high-performance optoelectronic devices due to their nontoxicity and extraordinary photophysical properties.

Abstract: Cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) is of interest for several technologies, including solar cells, and more recently, quantum devices via Rydberg excitons. It's performance in these capacities is strongly affected by defects in the crystal. The current best diagnostic for the presence of defects in a sample is the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, which shows a number of strong lines at energies below the band gap, with brightnesses dependent on the sample. However, the assignment of PL lines to particular defects has not been substantiated by modern theory. Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate from first principles which native defects introduce electronic states within the Cu$_2$O band gap, and therefore would produce lines in the PL spectrum. We find that the accepted assignments of lines to simple oxygen and copper vacancies are unsupported, and propose a new assignment based on oxygen and copper interstitials, and (one of the possible) split copper vacancies, a significant step towards the use of PL as a diagnostic tool for Cu$_2$O crystal growth.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12466v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strain-enhanced edge ferromagnetism and bipolar magnetic semiconducting behavior in Janus graphene nanoribbons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12582</link><description>arXiv:2602.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory and determinant quantum Monte Carlo methods, we show that Janus graphene nanoribbons with topological defect arrays ($m=2$) exhibit robust intrinsic ferromagnetism across widths $W=2-6$, with bandgaps exceeding 200 $meV$ and stable ferromagnetic ground states. Notably, uniaxial tensile strain significantly enhances their ferromagnetic properties: at 25\% strain, the Curie temperature increases to $222K$, a fivefold improvement over unstrained systems and the highest reported for graphene-based nanoribbons. Strain also induces a reversible transition to a bipolar magnetic semiconductor, with spin-flipped valence and conduction band edges beyond 10\% strain. This dual functionality, strain-enhanced ferromagnetism and strain-induced spin flip, stems from strain-modulated $p_{z}$ orbital hybridization and strong direct exchange interaction. Among these, $W=5$ Janus graphene nanoribbons emerge as potential candidates for room-temperature spintronic devices and strain-programmable quantum transport systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Room-Temperature Terahertz Photoconductivity Polarity Switching in High Entropy Nickelates with Implications for Photonic Synapses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12620</link><description>arXiv:2602.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy oxides (HEO) hold the potential to revolutionize the conventional material paradigms by leveraging high order of chemical disorder that induces highly desirable exotic phases for advanced applications. Here, we devise a methodology to enhance the efficiency of an artificial photonic synapse using a high entropy rare earth nickelate. Combined with epitaxial strain, we show that high entropy can further manipulate the phase of these locally disordered materials. Using time-averaged and time resolved Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy as dynamic probe, for the first time we show a rare combination of i) crystal axis dependent insulator to metal THz electronic phase transition and ii) coexistence of negative and positive THz photoconductivity at room temperature. Detailed analysis within theoretical models, including density functional theory (DFT)-based band structure calculations, suggest origin of these properties as disproportionate ordering of oxygen vacancies. Based on these findings, a conceptual THz-based artificial photonic synapse is proposed. This work underlines the pivotal role of HEO in advancing diverse THz functionalities, representing a critical step toward futuristic applications like THz-based high-speed computing and communication with an emphasis in THz frequency domain.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonparabolic dispersion of charge carriers in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12827</link><description>arXiv:2602.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion curves for the electrons and holes in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT), with the spin-orbit coupling taken into account. The effective masses of the charge carriers are obtained using the parabolic approximation of the dispersion curves in different directions in the $k$-space. It is found that the dispersion curves demonstrate strong nonparabolicity at energies above 0.2 eV for electrons and above 0.1 eV for holes, available for experimental study by the means of optical spectroscopy. We propose a model that describes the dispersion dependences of charge carriers at those energies, where the effective masses of the quasiparticles depend quadratically on the wave vector. An expression is obtained according to the model, which can accurately approximate the dispersion curves for the electron and the hole in all symmetric directions from the center to the boundary of the Brillouin zone.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The role of radiation-induced segregation in defect-phase formation in Ni-Ge and Ni-Si alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12860</link><description>arXiv:2602.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between chemical phase fields and structural defects play a key role in the properties of alloys. We illustrate the importance of these interactions in driven alloys, where defects are continuously being created, with particular focus on systems where radiation-induced segregation occurs. Specifically, we compare the microstructural evolution in undersaturated Ni-Si and Ni-Ge alloys during both 100 keV He and 2 MeV Ti irradiations. While the equilibrium phase diagrams of these systems are similar, and both systems show strong radiation-induced segregation, the evolving defect structures are remarkably different. Ni-Si reveals a high density of Frank loops, while Ni-Ge shows a complex array of dislocations. Moreover, a Ni3Ge precipitate shell is observed to coat He bubbles, while no segregation of Si is observed at such bubbles. We explain these differences in behaviors to solute drag by interstitial fluxes in Ni-Si vs solute drag by vacancy fluxes in Ni-Ge.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12860v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantitative Photoemission Predictions of Semiconducting Photocathodes from Many-Body Ab Initio Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12997</link><description>arXiv:2602.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-performance electron sources requires theoretical frameworks that accurately link the microscopic electronic properties of cathode materials to their macroscopic photoemission observables. Here, we present a many-body extension of the three-step photoemission model for semiconducting photocathodes, directly integrating the $GW$ approximation and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of density functional theory (DFT). This approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of standard DFT by explicitly accounting for quasiparticle and excitonic effects in the photoexcitation process. The quantum efficiency (QE) is evaluated by combining the ab initio absorption with an emission probability derived as an exciton-weighted average. We validate this model on representative alkali antimonides and demonstrate that a qualitative many-body description successfully captures complex spectral features that empirical models fail to reproduce. Furthermore, by incorporating macroscopic optical effects such as thin-film interference and polarization via Fresnel post-processing, we achieve quantitative agreement with experimental QE values without any adjustment. Minor discrepancies near the photoemission threshold are attributed to the idealized surface barrier adopted in the model and impurity effects in the samples, highlighting specific directions for future refinements. This work establishes a robust, parameter-free ab initio tool that bridges microscopic electronic correlation with macroscopic observables, providing a critical pathway for the rational design of next-generation electron sources.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12997v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modulated Anti-Ferroelectric Smectic Phases with Orthogonal and Tilted Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13034</link><description>arXiv:2602.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the ferroelectric nematic phase has brought with it a plethora of new polar liquid crystalline phases. One in particular is the anti-ferroelectric smectic A SmA\textsubscript{AF} phase. In this letter we show via observation and analysis of satellite peaks in the X-ray scattering pattern that the structure of the SmA\textsubscript{AF} phase involves a density modulation of $\approx$10-20 nm lateral to the smectic layer normal. Further, we demonstrate a previously undiscovered phase where the anti-ferroelectric order is maintained into a tilted smectic phase demonstrating the robustness of the underlying frustration that leads to the modulated structure. We suggest that the modulations are only in a single dimension and appear parallel to the tilt plane. This new phase also shows a significantly different and complex response to an electric field from other discovered polar LC phases due to the ability to modulate both tilt and polarisation direction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling the origin of the capacity fade in MnO$_{2}$ zinc-ion battery cathodes through an analysis of the Mn vacancy formation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13116</link><description>arXiv:2602.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently explored rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion battery (RAZIB) cathode materials, such as $\alpha$-MnO$_{2}$, suffer from severe capacity fade when cycling at rates appropriate for grid-scale operation. Mn dissolution has been previously identified as the cause of $\alpha$-MnO$_{2}$ cathode degradation during RAZIB cycling, with conflicting evidence being found in support of the proposed Jahn-Teller effect-assisted charge disproportionation reaction as the mechanism behind Mn dissolution. In order to unveil the Mn dissolution mechanism in MnO$_{2}$ cathode cells under RAZIB operation conditions, the energetic feasibility for Mn vacancy formation was probed in both charged (MnO$_{2}$) and discharged (ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$) phases of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ polymorphs of MnO$_{2}$ using density functional theory. The formation of a Mn vacancy, and consequently the dissolution of Mn as Mn$^{2+}_{(aq)}$, was found to be thermodynamically feasible for the $\alpha$-ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ phase due to the energetically unfavourable Zn bent coordination formed during the Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation process, indicating that Mn dissolution is promoted by an unstable Zn coordination environment. The theoretical calculations were then corroborated by operando $^{1}$H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments which captured the Mn dissolution occurring throughout the RAZIB discharge, with subsequent electrochemical deposition of the Mn atoms on the electrode during charge. The combined computational and experimental analysis reveals the critical role of defect energetics and coordination environment in driving active material dissolution, and consequently capacity fade, with the proposed mechanism also relevant for understanding cathode degradation in other intercalating ion battery chemistries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13116v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phonon properties and unconventional heat transfer in quasi-2D $Bi_2O_2Se$ crystal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05155</link><description>arXiv:2504.05155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.05155v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomistic modeling of uranium monocarbide with a machine learning interatomic potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17576</link><description>arXiv:2507.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranium monocarbide (UC) is an advanced ceramic fuel candidate due to its superior uranium density and thermal conductivity compared to traditional fuels. To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.17576v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Parameter-free prediction of irradiation defect structures in tungsten at room temperature using stochastic cluster dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18258</link><description>arXiv:2512.18258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work, we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics: each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18258v3</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia] Overcoming the sensitivity of sodium bismuth titanate towards sintering in a reducing atmosphere by defect chemistry engineering</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135964542600131X?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 14 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;

Abstract: Blinking and multiphoton emission in metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) limit their use as single-photon quantum emitters. Conventional models distinguish between trion-related A-type blinking and defect-assisted BC-type blinking, both expected to degrade single-photon purity in a dark state. Here, time-resolved spectroscopy on individual PQDs reveals a qualitatively different regime in which low emitting dark states exhibit higher single-photon purity than bright states. For those PQDs state-resolved $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ analysis shows that the exciton photoluminescence quantum yield decreases by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the biexciton one is suppressed by a factor of $\sim 10$. This leads to a moderate improvement of single-photon purity with $g^{(2)}_0$ decreased from 0.155 to 0.120. In contrast, PQDs with fluorescence lifetime--intensity distribution patterns characteristic for A-type blinking, display the expected increase of $g^{(2)}_0$ in charged, trion-dominated states. To explain the observed improvement of single-photon purity of low-emitting dark states, we propose a self-trapped-exciton (STE) mechanism that selectively blocks biexciton formation by diverting hot excitons into long-lived, weakly emissive STE configurations. This STE-mediated blinking channel explains why certain low-emitting states improve, rather than degrade, single-photon purity and suggests a lattice-driven route to perovskite quantum emitters with intrinsically suppressed multiphoton events.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nanoscopic Imaging of Acoustic Dynamics in van der Waals Ferroelectric NbOI2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11504</link><description>arXiv:2602.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how low-dimensional ferroelectrics respond to ultrafast excitation at nanoscales is essential for controlling energy flow and mechanical functionality in next-generation polar materials and devices. Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved structural dynamics in the van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI2 using combined ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction. Above-band-gap photoexcitation rapidly screens the in-plane polarization and heats the lattice, launching three coherent acoustic phonons: two transverse shear modes and one longitudinal breathing mode. The transverse mode that shears the layers perpendicular to the in-plane polar axis dominates over that along the polar axis, reflecting anisotropic coupling between polarization and strain. Spatially resolved measurements further reveal spatially correlated heterogeneity in the mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Regions dominated by a single shear mode exhibit significantly longer lifetime of acoustic oscillations than that of multimode regions, suggesting that acoustic phonon-phonon scattering is a major source of decoherence. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of polarization-strain coupling and spatially heterogeneous energy dissipation in van der Waals ferroelectrics under ultrafast excitation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11504v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient molecular dynamics simulation of 2D penta-silicene materials using machine learning potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11548</link><description>arXiv:2602.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are a modern computational method that allows achieving near-quantum mechanical accuracy (DFT) while still describing large-scale systems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we use MLIP from DeepMD package and the classical Tersoff potential for SiC (Tersoff.SiC potential) to fully and accurately describe atomic interactions and apply them to molecular dynamics simulations of penta silicene sheet. The results show that the melting points (T$_g$) temperatures of the system in the canonical NVT and isobaric NPT sets are 632 K and 606 K, while the Tersoff.SiC potential have the high melting points, respectively. In addition, the radial distribution function exhibits characteristic peaks at interatomic distances of 2.275 \AA \text{} and 2.375 \AA, while the Tersoff.SiC potential only describe distance of 2.375 \AA. Furthermore, penta silicene was also simulated using on-the-fly machine learning for 10 ps to evaluate the structural stability of the system. This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional penta silicene sheets with pentagonal structures using a high-precision, cost-effective method, contributing further evidence to support experimental synthesis and opening up potential future applications of this material.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How unconventional oxidation state Au$^{2+}$ is stabilized in halide perovskite Cs$_4$Au$_3$Cl$_{12}$: a first-principles study of its polaron crystal nature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11572</link><description>arXiv:2602.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gold in crystalline compounds is typically only stable in oxidation states Au1+ and Au3+. Even compounds with nominal Au2+ usually disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. Recently, Cs4Au3Cl12 was synthesized, where gold took the 2+ state in the bulk. Here, we investigate this compound using first-principles calculations and show that stabilization of the Au2+ ion is through the formation of a polaron crystal. The electronic and phononic structure suggest that the bonding network can be interpreted as a collection of [Au2+Cl4]2- and [Au3+Cl4]1- square planar motifs, and the crystal lacks a smooth pathway for Au2+ to disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. The electronic states of Au are contained within each [AuCl4] motif, which allows for the Au2+ state to be localized and isolated electronically. The Au2+-sites form an ordered structure, which is driven by a strong repulsive interaction between [Au2+Cl4]2- motifs due to their lattice distortion. The electron-phonon coupling between Au2+ and Cl explains the stability of Au2+, which suggests this material to be interpreted as a polaron crystal. By considering redox reaction, we show that Cs4Au3Cl12 has the maximal density of Au2+, and further oxidation will induce a delocalized state. Cs4Au3Cl12 has distinctive electronic structure, with a narrow gap, isolated HOMO and LUMO bands strongly localized at the Au-sites, and magnetization at the Au2+-sites making Cs4Au3Cl12 unique among quantum materials. Magnetism in gold is rare, and Cs4Au3Cl12 can be a testbed to explore novel gold chemistry as well as polaron crystal transport. The strategy to stabilize an unconventional oxidation state through engineering of lattice distortions is quite general; therefore, we propose that a similar approach will be applicable to a wide variety of transition metal compounds.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of a Helical Metal in Rippled Ultrathin Topological Insulator Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{3} on Graphene</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11932</link><description>arXiv:2602.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of topological insulators (TIs) with graphene offers a pathway to engineer hybrid quantum states, yet the impact of strain at the 2D limit remains a critical open question. Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moir\'e ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Melting of quantum Hall Wigner and bubble crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11963</link><description>arXiv:2602.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional crystal melts via the proliferation and unbinding of topological defects, yet quantitatively predicting the melting temperature $T_m$ in real systems is challenging. Here we resolve this discrepancy in quantum Hall electron bubble phases by combining Corbino-geometry transport experiment in an ultraclean GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well for Landau levels 2 to 5 with Hartree--Fock elasticity and the full Kosterlitz--Thouless--Halperin--Nelson--Young melting criterion including the finite-temperature renormalization-group calculation. The theoretically obtained $T_m$ quantitatively captures the measured solid-liquid phase transition boundaries across all probed ranges, validating the bubble-crystal interpretation and establishing defect--mediated melting as a predictive framework for strongly interacting electronic solids. This agreement further supports using bulk transport to probe the energetics of topological defects and screening in quantum Hall physics, and the approach is readily extendable to other electronic crystals, including the generalized Wigner crystal in moir\'e Chern bands.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological chiral random walker</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12020</link><description>arXiv:2602.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological and synthetic systems achieve robust function in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge across the physical and life sciences. To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12053</link><description>arXiv:2602.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lightweight Error-Correction Code Encoders in Superconducting Electronic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00962</link><description>arXiv:2509.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00962v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural control of two-level defect density revealed by high-throughput correlative measurements of Josephson junctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11469</link><description>arXiv:2602.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials defects in Josephson junctions (JJs), often referred to as two-level systems (TLS), couple to superconducting qubits and are a critical bottleneck for scalable quantum processors. Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11469v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link><description>arXiv:2602.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamics of ballistic photocurrents driven by Coulomb scattering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06320</link><description>arXiv:2408.06320v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work, we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics: each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18258v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field-Dependent Qubit Flux Noise Simulated from Materials-Specific Disordered Exchange Interactions Between Paramagnetic Adsorbates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09471</link><description>arXiv:2602.09471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09471v2</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Bandgap modulation in self-limited two-dimensional Ga 2 O 3  films via defect engineering</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/062107/3380045/Bandgap-modulation-in-self-limited-two-dimensional</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;We demonstrated the controllable exfoliation of two-dimensional gallium oxide (2D-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) thin films via a touch printing process that leverages the self-limiting oxidation behavior of liquid gallium.

Abstract: Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chiral states induced by symmetry-breaking in $\alpha-T_3$ lattices: Magnetic field effect</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10288</link><description>arXiv:2602.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sublattice-symmetry breaking in the $\alpha-T_3$ lattice leads to a bandgap opening. A defect line in the substrate on which the $\alpha-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $\alpha$. The latter tunes the $\alpha-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($\alpha=0$) to a dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $\Delta(x) diag(1,\quad -1,\quad 1)$, assuming $\Delta(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $\alpha$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed. We demonstrate lifting of Landau levels degeneracy and of valley degeneracy. Our findings pave the way for proposing valley filter devices based on any evolutionary stage between the honeycomb-like and dice lattice structures of the $\alpha-T_3$ phase, controlled by external fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10288v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Possible Proximity to Ferromagnetism in the V$_2$Ga$_5$ Superconductor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10313</link><description>arXiv:2602.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are generally competing ground states in $d$-electron systems, making their interplay of fundamental interest. We report a comprehensive study of high-quality single- and polycrystalline V$_2$Ga$_5$, a bulk type-II superconductor ($T_c = 3.54 \ K$) with a quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure, supplemented with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting possible proximity to ferromagnetic order. Below $T \approx 10 \ K$, magnetic susceptibility shows ZFC/FC splitting, along with saturation and hysteresis in $M(H)$. Moreover, electrical transport measurements reveal a magnetic-field-dependent resistivity upturn, while specific heat is enhanced in magnetic fields. DFT calculations show that the Fermi level in V$_2$Ga$_5$ is located at a peak in the density of states, with a small magnetic moment per unit cell comparable to the experimental value. Together, these results indicate the possibility that ferromagnetic correlations develop below $T \approx 10 \ K$, well above $T_c$, with long-range ferromagnetic order suppressed by the superconducting transition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10313v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Biaxial Strain Control of Helimagnetism via Chemical Expansion in Thin Film SrFeO3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10372</link><description>arXiv:2602.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate control of helimagnetic order in biaxially strained SrFeO3 thin films using neutron diffraction and resonant soft x-ray scattering. SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10372v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect structures and transitions in active nematic membranes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10521</link><description>arXiv:2602.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of active nematic liquid crystals on deformable membranes, focusing on the interplay between active stress and anisotropic curvature coupling. Using a minimal model, we simulate the coupled evolution of the nematic order parameter and membrane height. We demonstrate a continuous transition from a curvature-dominated regime, where topological defects are trapped by local deformation, to an activity-dominated regime exhibiting active turbulence. A scaling analysis reveals that the critical activity threshold $\zeta_c$ scales as $\alpha^2/\kappa$, where $\alpha$ and $\kappa$ are the coupling constant and bending stiffness, respectively; this relationship is confirmed by our numerical results. Furthermore, we find that significant correlations between the orientational pattern and membrane geometry persist even in the turbulent regime. Specifically, we identify that "walls" in the director field induce characteristic wave-like curvature profiles, providing a mechanism for dynamic coupling between order and shape. These results offer a physical framework for understanding defect-mediated deformation in nonequilibrium biological membranes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric Quantum Point Contact in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10554</link><description>arXiv:2602.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moir\'e domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moir\'e domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moir\'e domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moir\'e domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moir\'e domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spatial homogeneity of superconducting order parameter in NbN films grown by atomic layer deposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10839</link><description>arXiv:2602.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their high kinetic inductance, highly disordered superconducting thin films are a potential hardware for the realization of compact, low-noise elements in cryoelectronic applications. However, high disorder typically results in structural defects that cause spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter, thereby impairing the film's properties. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that NbN thin films fabricated by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) exhibit unusual spatial homogeneity, even at thicknesses approaching the superconductor-insulator transition. Tunneling spectra acquired across the sample surface show only small variations of the order parameter with a standard deviation of 2-3%, on length scales that significantly exceed the film's grain size. At the same time, the films achieve a relatively high sheet resistance (up to 1400 Ohm) and, consequently, a high sheet kinetic inductance (up to approximately 200 pH), making them well-suited for applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On generating Special Quasirandom Structures: Optimization for the DFT computational efficiency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10872</link><description>arXiv:2602.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our novel evolutionary algorithm for generating Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) designed to optimize the computational efficiency of Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations. Operating on the premise that symmetry proxies non-randomness, we rigorously filter out 1.P1 candidate structures prior to evaluating correlation functions. Our extinction-based workflow includes the seeding, filtration, evaluation, extinction, and repopulation phases to produce efficient supercells with maximal local environmental distinctness. We compare our results against those generated by established software packages, on the example of the W\textsubscript{70}Cr\textsubscript{30} alloy. Although standard tools achieve (marginally) lower correlation errors, our best-performing structures require approximately five times fewer unique displacements for phonon calculations. This approach sacrifices negligible quantitative disorder accuracy to significantly reduce the computational cost of modeling thermal properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10872v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vertically Correlated Disorder and Structured Interlayer Tunneling in Cuprates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11014</link><description>arXiv:2602.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuprate superconductors display robust in-plane electronic correlations but exceptionally fragile interlayer coherence. We suggest that even weak vertically correlated disorder (arising from interstitial-oxygen staging, twin boundaries, extended strain fields, or defect-pinned charge textures) can impose a layer-dependent modulation of the interlayer tunneling amplitude t(z). Because the bare interlayer coupling is intrinsically small, such modulations generate an effectively multichannel c-axis electrodynamic response, consistent with multi-component Josephson plasma resonances, nonmonotonic c-axis resistivity, redistribution of bilayer magnetic spectral weight, and field-enhanced vertical CDW correlations. We propose a phenomenological framework in which the organization of disorder, rather than its magnitude, governs the effective interlayer coupling and its electrodynamic signatures. This viewpoint unifies diverse c-axis anomalies across several cuprate families, suggesting that controlling vertical disorder correlations offers a viable pathway for tuning dimensionality and interlayer coherence in high-Tc superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spontaneous phase separation and pattern formation in a lyotropic nematic mixture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11101</link><description>arXiv:2602.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyotropic liquid crystals can display rich phase behaviour and self-organisation, yet the physical principles underlying their self-assembly into large scale patterns remains understudied. Here, we combine theory, simulations and experiments on Sunset Yellow-water chromonic mixtures to show that such materials spontaneously phase separate, even without assuming any underlying microscopic attraction between the molecular species. In our minimal model, demixing depends solely on the Onsager-like coupling between local nematogen density and orientational order. If such a coupling is sufficiently strong, nematic defects trigger the nucleation of isotropic droplets, which then coalesce due to elastic or interfacial tensions. We further show that strong anchoring of the director field at the interface arrests this coarsening process, resulting in a stable microphase separated lamellar pattern. This self-assembled smectic phase has striking and unusual features, including spontaneous undulations, heterogeneous layer spacing, long-lived glassy defect patterns and lamellar onions. Our results identify orientational-density coupling and elastocapillarity as fundamental mechanisms to guide self-assembly in lyotropic and chromonic liquid crystals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11101v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reed-Muller Error-Correction Code Encoder for SFQ-to-CMOS Interface Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11140</link><description>arXiv:2602.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting digital electronics such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic to semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is subject to bit errors due to, e.g., flux trapping, process parameter variations (PPV), and fabrication defects. In this paper, a lightweight hardware-efficient error-correction code encoder is designed and analyzed. Particularly, a Reed-Muller code RM(1,3) encoder is implemented with SFQ digital logic. The proposed RM(1,3) encoder converts a 4-bit message into an 8-bit codeword and can detect and correct up to 3- and 1-bit errors, respectively. This encoder circuit is designed using MIT-LL SFQ5ee process and SuperTools/ColdFlux RSFQ cell library. A simulation framework integrating JoSIM simulator and MATLAB script for automated data collection and analysis, is proposed to study the performance of RM(1,3) encoder. The proposed encoder improves the probability of having no bit errors by 6.7% as compared to an encoder-less design under $\pm20\%$ PPV. With $\pm15\%$ and lower PPV, the proposed encoder could correct all errors with at least 99.1% probability. The impact of fabrication defects such as open circuit faults on the encoder circuit is also studied using the proposed framework.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Impact of interface defects on the band alignment and performance of TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19594</link><description>arXiv:2406.19594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is essential for enhancing their performance, improving their stability, and making them commercially viable for large-scale deployment in solar energy harvesting applications. Point defects, like vacancies, have a dual role, as they can inherently provide a proper doping, but they can also reduce the collected current by trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, they can play an active role in ion migration and degradation. Using {\it ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the changes in the band alignment induced by interfacial vacancy defects in a TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O based PSC. Depending on the type of the vacancy (Ti, Cu, O, Pb, I) in the oxide and perovskite materials, additional doping is superimposed on the already existing background. Their effect on the performance of the PSCs becomes visible, as shown by SCAPS simulations. The most significant impact is observed for $p$ type doping of TiO$_2$ and $n$ type doping of Cu$_2$O, while the effective doping of the perovskite layer affects one of the two interfaces. We discuss these results based on modifications of the band structure near the active interfaces and provide further insights concerning the optimization of electron and hole collection.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.19594v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetoelectric training of multiferroic domains in Mn$_2$GeO$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23583</link><description>arXiv:2503.23583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics promise direct cross-control between coexisting ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders, which is of interest for applications in magnetism and spintronics. A particularly interesting type of cross-control is found in spin-spiral multiferroic Mn$_2$GeO$_4$, where a ferroelectric multi-domain distribution can be globally inverted by a single magnetic field sweep. In this work we consider the initial domain evolution from zero-field cooling, imaging the evolution of domains under both magnetic and electric fields via optical second harmonic generation. We find that polarization and magnetization domains form independently when entering the multiferroic phase, and a single deterministic initialisation procedure, spanning three quarters of a field cycle, is required to achieve reliable magnetoelectric cross-coupling. This initialisation behaviour originates from a deterministic pathway from metastable to equilibrium domain patterns, in contrast to more common and less reliable domain "training" procedures that require repeated field cycles. Understanding the initial domain evolution thus enables reliable cross-control in magnetoelectric devices with highly interlinked order parameters.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.23583v2</guid></item><item><title>[Chem Catalysis] Solvent-free photocatalytic propane oxidation to acetone with heterogenized decatungstate</title><link>https://www.cell.com/chem-catalysis/fulltext/S2667-1093(25)00345-8?rss=yes</link><description>The selective oxidation of light alkanes remains a long-standing challenge in catalysis.

Consequently, their wide-bandgap variants (1.65–2.0 eV) are particularly well-suited for use as top cells in tandem solar cell configurations. However, their development remains hindered by certain challenges, such as halide segregation and high defect density. While previous reviews have summarized advances in this field, there is a lack of a comprehensive discussion that spans from challenges to development and applications. This article, from the perspectives of material and process optimization, specifically focuses on the latest breakthroughs achieved over the past year. It systematically outlines strategies, including additive engineering, crystallization kinetics regulation, and interface engineering, to realize defect passivation, film quality improvement, and device performance enhancement. This review not only delves into the mechanistic understanding of halide segregation but also analyzes recent research progress on the integration of wide-bandgap perovskite top cells with various bottom cells, such as copper indium gallium selenide, silicon, narrow-bandgap perovskites, and organic solar cells.

Nonetheless, intrinsic perovskite imperfections, caused by lattice strain and phase segregation, severely hindered the urgent advancement of efficient WBG-PSCs. These imperfections lead to detrimental non-radiative recombination, which limits device performance and accelerates device degradation. In this study, we incorporated 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide into the perovskite surface, effectively mitigating residual strain and suppressing phase separation. Through this synergy, the device effectively suppresses the formation of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inactive phases, minimizes interfacial defect generation, and enhances both carrier lifetime and transport properties. Consequently, we developed the WBG-PSCs with a bandgap of 1.66 eV, achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% with a high open-circuit voltage (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.23 V. More importantly, these unencapsulated devices demonstrated excellent environmental stability, maintaining 90.25% of their initial PCE after 1500 h in an atmospheric environment with 35% relative humidity. This study provides a simple and effective strategy to improve the efficiency and stability of WBG-PSCs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061603/3379900/Lattice-strain-conversion-suppresses-ion-migration</guid></item><item><title>[APL Materials Current Issue] Revealing intrinsic strain and domain evolution across the pristine phase transition using PbTiO 3  epitaxial films with negligible residual strain</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/2/021105/3379363/Revealing-intrinsic-strain-and-domain-evolution</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Displacive ferroelectrics exhibit a strong coupling between lattice anisotropy and intrinsic structural distortions, and epitaxial constraints in thin films make it essential to directly monitor strain-driven structural responses under controlled conditions.

Abstract: Understanding how water interacts with graphene at the molecular level is essential for advancing nanomaterial applications in filtration, catalysis, and environmental technologies. This study establishes a quantitative baseline for assessing how structural defects, dopants, or surface functionalization may enhance water adsorption, providing insights for the rational design of graphene-based materials in water purification, sensing, and nanofluidic applications. In this work, we employed density functional theory (DFT) with the vdW-C09 functional to investigate the adsorption of a single water molecule on pristine graphene, accurately accounting for long-range dispersion forces. Three high-symmetry adsorption sites-the center of the hexagonal ring, the C-C bond, and the top site-were explored in combination with three molecular orientations: Down, H-bond, and Up configurations. The calculated adsorption energies range from -93 to -145 meV (milli-electron volts), indicating that the interaction is dominated by weak van der Waals forces characteristic of physisorption. The most stable configuration corresponds to the Down orientation above the center of the hexagonal ring, with an adsorption energy of -145 meV and an equilibrium distance of 3.27 A (angstrom), defined as the vertical separation between the oxygen atom of the water molecule and the graphene plane. These results are in close agreement with previous theoretical studies and confirm the non-reactive and hydrophobic nature of pristine graphene.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09184v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09262</link><description>arXiv:2602.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods of ferroelectricity control are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains, and appropriate modelling of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the nanoparticles are absent too. In this work we study the influence of chemical stresses on phase diagrams and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, antipolar and nonpolar order parameters. It appeared that the ferroelectric phase can be reentrant with respect to the size of nanoparticles, because the spontaneous polarization exists in the limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is mainly determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The maximal critical radius R_cr^max is mainly determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses, which are induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Analytical expressions derived for the critical radii can be generalized for hafnium-zirconium oxide nanoparticles, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deformation potential driven photostriction in layered ferroelectrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09275</link><description>arXiv:2602.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between electronic excitations and lattice deformation in van der Waals ferroelectrics is governed by a competition between the electron deformation potential and the inverse piezoelectric effect. While theory predicts that piezoelectric screening should drive a polar-axis contraction in monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides, we demonstrate that in multilayer SnS, the deformation potential provides the dominant contribution, driving a polar-axis expansion even within ferroelectric domains. By correlating polarization-resolved second-harmonic generation microscopy with ultrafast reflectance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we resolve the anisotropic lattice response and disentangle intrinsic photostrictive strain from extrinsic thin-film interference artifacts. These results establish a microscopic hierarchy of photostrictive mechanisms and position stacking-engineered SnS as a platform for ultrafast optomechanical transduction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Three-dimensional real-space electron dynamics in graphene driven by strong laser fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09440</link><description>arXiv:2602.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the three-dimensional (3D) electron dynamics of graphene in real space under strong laser fields using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We successfully reproduce the reversal of current direction originating from the cancellation of two oppositely directed residual currents, as previously predicted by Morimoto et al. [Y. Morimoto et al., New J. Phys. 24, 033051 (2022)]. By distinguishing contributions from individual orbitals, our results validate the two-level system approximation and also emphasize that the first-principles approach agrees better with experimental results for light-driven residual current, especially in extremely strong fields. Furthermore, our 3D model reveals that the real-space atomic-scale current induced by strong laser fields is concentrated slightly above and below the graphene basal plane, rather than strictly within it. The two oppositely directed currents exhibit a pronounced height separation in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the ring current is not confined to the graphene plane but forms a rotating 3D circulation loop which is absent in the reduced-dimensional model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field-Dependent Qubit Flux Noise Simulated from Materials-Specific Disordered Exchange Interactions Between Paramagnetic Adsorbates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09471</link><description>arXiv:2602.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interaction-driven spin polaron in itinerant flat-band ferromagnetism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09545</link><description>arXiv:2602.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction effects are dramatically enhanced in flat-band systems due to quenched kinetics, facilitating the binding of single excitations into composite quasiparticles. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of spin polarons over the entire momentum and energy space within the Mielke-Tasaki model using projected exact diagonalization. We identify distinct low-energy spin polarons at momenta q=0 and q=\pi, and also find multiple high-energy branches of spin polaron. It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons. Furthermore, by introducing a finite bandwidth, we unravel the underlying binding mechanisms: the formation of low-energy spin polarons is governed by the conventional virtual exchange mechanism, whereas the high-energy spin polarons arise from a joint effect of the effective attraction and virtual exchange. Our results suggest promising avenues for realizing spin polaron crystals and exploring novel superconducting pairing mechanisms in moir\'e materials like twisted WSe2 and MoTe2.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09545v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scattering theory of spin waves by lattice dislocation defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09546</link><description>arXiv:2602.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-wave propagation in magnetic insulators in the presence of lattice dislocations. Within a continuum magnetoelastic framework, we show that the strain fields generated by dislocations induce equilibrium magnetic textures. The morphology of these textures depends sensitively on the dislocation type and acts as a localized scattering potential for spin-wave excitations. As a result, the scattering response exhibits pronounced asymmetries and interference effects governed by the magnetoelastic coupling and the dislocation type. By combining numerical simulations with analytical scattering theory, we compute differential cross sections and frequency-dependent transmission coefficients. Furthermore, analysis of the effective potential landscape reveals that the defect forms a barrier that modulates spin-wave transport and, crucially, breaks the intrinsic reflectionless nature of magnetic domain walls. Our findings identify lattice dislocations as tunable scattering centers, opening new avenues for defect engineering in magnonic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cavity control of multiferroic order in single-layer NiI$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09641</link><description>arXiv:2602.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling materials through their interactions with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations is an emergent frontier in material engineering. Although recent experiments have demonstrated dark cavity effects for electronic material phases, like superconductivity, ferroelectricity and charge density waves, a smoking gun experiment for magnetic systems is lacking. Largely, this comes from the focus on phase transitions, where a large critical light-matter coupling is needed to observe cavity modifications. Here, we propose spiral magnets, where even a small cavity-mediated change in magnetic interactions is reflected in a change of the spiral wavelength, as a promising platform to observe cavity effects. We focus on the single-layer multiferroic NiI$_2$, interacting with electric field fluctuations from surface phonon polaritons of the paraelectric substrate SrTiO$_3$. With decreasing substrate-material distance, the ratio of nearest and third nearest neighbor exchange interactions reduces, leading to an increase of the spiral wavelength and an eventual transition into a ferromagnetic state. Our work identifies a realistic platform to observe cavity vacuum renormalization effects in magnetic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton fine structure in CdSe nanoplatelets using a quasi-2D screened configuration-interaction framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09844</link><description>arXiv:2602.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute exciton binding energies and fine-structure splittings in CdSe nanoplatelets with two zincblende geometries and one wurtzite geometry, finding that the wurtzite structure exhibits the largest bright-bright splitting due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, while the zincblende structures show smaller but finite splittings arising from atomistic symmetry breaking at edges and corners. These results are obtained using a theoretical framework that we developed, which combines DFT single-particle states with screened configuration interaction, a quasi-2D dielectric screening model, and an efficient Coulomb-cutoff scheme that eliminates periodic-image interactions and enables accurate Coulomb and exchange integrals at low computational cost. This methodology provides a transferable and practical route for studying excitons in CdSe nanoplatelets and other quasi-two-dimensional nanomaterials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09844v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined DFT recipe and renormalisation of band-edge parameters for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$ informed by the measured spin-orbit splitting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09858</link><description>arXiv:2602.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conduction band-edge spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides determines a competition between bright and dark excitons and sets conditions for spintronics applications of these semiconductors. Here, we report the SOS measurement for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$, found from the threshold density, $n_*$, for the upper spin-orbit-split band population, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the values expected from the conventional density functional theory (DFT). Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Long-Range Machine Learning of Electron Density for Twisted Bilayer Moir\'e Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09938</link><description>arXiv:2602.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit rich quantum phenomena, but ab initio modelling of these systems remains computationally prohibitive. Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moir\'e materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11100</link><description>arXiv:2503.11100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline through moisture-induced degradation (MID) involving multiple mechanisms including encapsulant hydrolysis and metal ion migration. Among these mechanisms, the role of water-derived hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects represents an underexplored yet fundamental degradation pathway. This study employs density functional theory and quantum transport theory to investigate hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects as a novel perspective for understanding MID mechanisms. Results reveal that neutral hydrogen interstitials at bond-center sites exhibit low diffusion barriers (0.96 eV) and act as deep-level recombination centers, while oxygen interstitials face higher diffusion barriers (2.2 eV) with limited trapping capability. Device simulations demonstrate that hydrogen defects cause substantially more pronounced photovoltaic current degradation through enhanced non-radiative recombination. Critically, under humid conditions, hydrogen from water molecules readily penetrates silicon lattices forming active recombination centers, while oxygen incorporation remains kinetically limited with negligible impact. This interstitial defect perspective provides novel understanding of MID mechanisms, explaining why moisture exposure primarily degrades silicon solar cells through hydrogen rather than oxygen incorporation, offering fundamental insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.11100v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- and consequent motion -- in active nematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19665</link><description>arXiv:2504.19665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.19665v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Screening novel cathode materials from the Energy-GNoME database using MACE machine learning force field and DFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22504</link><description>arXiv:2511.22504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we employ a multi-fidelity screening protocol combining the Energy-GNoME confident criteria, foundational MACE machine-learning force fields (MLFF), and physically motivated heuristic filters to identify novel intercalation cathodes for post-lithium batteries, namely: Na-, K-, Mg-, and Ca-ion batteries. Foundational MACE models are used to efficiently asses dynamical stability, thermodynamical stability, average voltage, and theoretical specific energy, enabling a rapid screening of candidates. For the most promising cathodes, voltage predictions are refined using DFT+U calculations. This work delivers three key outcomes: i) establishing and validating a robust high-throughput screening approach for cathode materials with foundational MLFF models; ii) suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation of batteries; iii) a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy-GNoME database on the examined materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.22504v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-Principles Investigation of X2NiH6 (X = Ca, Sr, Ba) Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01072</link><description>arXiv:2512.01072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles DFT calculations on the hydrides Ca2NiH6, Sr2NiH6, and Ba2NiH6 reveal key thermodynamic properties. These compounds exhibit increasing entropy and heat capacity with temperature, and are thermodynamically stable at elevated temperatures due to negative free energies. The kinetics of hydrogen storage is influenced by entropy changes during hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Optically, Ba2NiH6 shows a high refractive index at low energies. Mechanical assessments indicate Sr2NiH6 is incompressible with moderate malleability, Ca2NiH6 has the highest resistance to deformation, while Ba2NiH6 is most compressible. Formation energies and hydrogen storage capacities (4.005 wt% for Ca2NiH6, 2.548 wt% for Sr2NiH6, and 1.750 wt% for Ba2NiH6) highlight Ca2NiH6 as the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage technology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01072v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07295</link><description>arXiv:2602.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21808</link><description>arXiv:2512.21808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder.

By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21808v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] From Disorder to Function: Entropy-Engineered Broadband Photonics with Ion-Transport-Stabilized Spectral Fidelity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24328</link><description>arXiv:2512.24328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-entropy halide-perovskite field has expanded rapidly, yet a key gap remains: configurational entropy is not yet a reliable, designable lever to co-deliver expanded photonic functionality and operational robustness with a composition-transferable mechanistic basis. Here we develop entropy-engineered rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb, RE)Cl6 (RE3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), that simultaneously expand near-infrared (NIR) functionality and establish a mechanistic stability rule. Near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase high-entropy solid solution (Delta_Sconfig about 1.6R). Sb3+ serves as a sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide channels, transforming the parent single-mode response into a broadband NIR output (~850-1600 nm) with three spectrally orthogonal fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced output enables redundancy-based ratiometric solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing with reduced susceptibility to intensity drift. Accelerated aging under humidity and oxygen shows improved phase and emission stability versus single-component analogues. DFT and molecular dynamics attribute the robustness to strongly suppressed RE$^{3+}$/Cl$^-$ self-diffusion despite comparable H$_2$O/O$_2$ adsorption, kinetically impeding ion-migration-assisted reconstruction and degradation. Integration into a phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, broadband NIR illumination, establishing entropy engineering as a practical handle to couple expanded photonic functionality with mechanistically accountable durability in metal-halide photonics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24328v2</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Dynamics of ferroelectric switching in copolymer P(VDF-TrFE) films: Evidence for nanoscale monodomain structure</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/062902/3379340/Dynamics-of-ferroelectric-switching-in-copolymer-P</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The mechanisms of ferroelectric switching in ferroelectric polymers have been the focus of many detailed investigations, but several aspects remain unclear.

Notably, the extrapolated fatigue-endurance number at room temperature reaches an impressive high value of 5.26 × 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; cycles.

Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing Band Gaps in Ensemble Density Functional Theory using Thermodynamic Limits of Finite One-Dimensional Model Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07317</link><description>arXiv:2602.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a promising extension to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for calculating excited states. While Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences underestimate gaps, EDFT has been shown to provide more accurate excitation energies in atoms, molecules and isolated model systems. However, it is unclear whether EDFT is capable of calculating band gaps of periodic systems -- and what an appropriate theoretical formulation would be to describe periodic systems. We explored how EDFT could calculate band gaps by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly wide finite versions of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney (KP) periodic model. We use Octopus, an ab initio, open-source, real-space DFT code, as in our previous work [R. J. Leano et al., Electron. Struct. 6, 035003 (2024)] in which we found with "particle in a box" models that EDFT can provide a reasonable effective mass correction for the homogeneous electron gas. Now, we use a periodic reference that is gapped. We find that the finite systems' Kohn-Sham gap approaches the same periodic limit for each of three ways of terminating the finite system, though the appropriate states corresponding to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have to be carefully identified in each case. Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit. The results indicate that EDFT is promising for periodic systems, to motivate further work on developing a suitable formalism.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07317v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] ELAS3D-Xtal: An OpenMP-accelerated crystal elasticity solver with automated experiment-driven microstructure generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07354</link><description>arXiv:2602.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ELAS3D-Xtal, a high-performance Fortran/OpenMP upgrade of the NIST ELAS3D voxel-based finite element solver for computing 3D elastic fields in polycrystals with defects. The code supports crystal anisotropy by precomputing rotated stiffness tensors from user-specified orientations and solves the equilibrium problem with a matrix-free, OpenMP-parallel preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method using a point-block Jacobi preconditioner. On a single shared-memory multicore PC, OpenMP threading accelerates the baseline CG solver by ~10X, while the block-preconditioned CG solver achieves 53-61X speedup relative to the serial CG baseline for meshes from 100^3 to 500^3 voxels (scaling to domains up to 800^3 voxels). Accuracy is validated against the analytical Eshelby inclusion solution. ELAS3D-Xtal also integrates microstructure construction, including statistically calibrated polycrystal generation via spatial filtering and parallel voxel-to-grain assignment, direct pore insertion from XCT centroid/radius data, and texture assignment. Full-field phase, orientation, and stress outputs are written in HDF5 to enable scalable post-processing and defect-mechanics workflows. Applications are demonstrated for (i) anisotropy-controlled defect-scale stress fields and (ii) LPBF SS316L microstructures with gas, lack-of-fusion, and keyhole pore morphologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Positron annihilation lifetime and Doppler broadening spectral calculations of oxygen-doped 3C-SiC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07516</link><description>arXiv:2602.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on density functional theory (DFT), the formation energies of intrinsic vacancy defects (VC, VSi, and VSi+C) and oxygen-related defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC) in 3C-SiC are systematically investigated. The results indicate that all defects considered, except for OC, possess neutral or negative charge states, thereby making them suitable for detection by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). Furthermore, the electron and positron density distributions and positron annihilation lifetimes for the perfect 3C-SiC supercell and various defective configurations are computed. It is found that the OSi and OSiVC complexes act as effective positron trapping centers, leading to the formation of positron trapped states and a notable increase in annihilation lifetimes at the corresponding defect sites. In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) spectra, along with the S and W parameters, are calculated for both intrinsic and oxygen-doped point defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC). The analysis reveals that electron screening effects dominate the annihilation characteristics of the OSi defect, whereas positron localization induced by the vacancy is the predominant contributor in the case of OSiVC. This distinction results in clearly different momentum distributions of these two oxygen-related defects for different charge states. Overall, the PAS is demonstrated to be a powerful technique for distinguishing intrinsic vacancy-type defects and oxygen-doped composites in 3C-SiC. Combining the analysis of electron and positron density distributions, the electron localization and positron trapping behavior in defect systems with different charge states can be comprehensively understood. These first-principles results provide a solid theoretical foundation for identifying and characterizing the defects in oxygen-doped 3C-SiC by using PAS.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effect of metal encapsulation on bulk superconducting properties of niobium thin films used in qubits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07617</link><description>arXiv:2602.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium metal occupies nearly 100\% of the volume of a typical 2D transmon device. While the aluminum Josephson junction is of utmost importance, maintaining quantum coherence across the entire device means that pair-breaking in Nb leads, capacitive pads, and readout resonators can be a major source of decoherence. The established contributors are surface oxides and hydroxides, as well as absorbed hydrogen and oxygen. Metal encapsulation of freshly grown surfaces with non-oxidizing metals, preferably without breaking the vacuum, is a successful strategy to mitigate these issues. While the positive effects of encapsulation are undeniable, it is important to understand its impact on the macroscopic behavior of niobium films. We present a comprehensive study of the bulk superconducting properties of Nb thin films encapsulated with gold and palladium/gold, and compare them to those of bare Nb films. Magneto-optical imaging, magnetization, resistivity, and London and Campbell penetration depth measurements reveal significant differences in encapsulated samples. Both sputtered, and epitaxial Au-capped films exhibit the highest residual resistivity ratio and superconducting transition temperature, as well as the lowest upper critical field, London penetration depth, and critical current. These results are in good agreement with the microscopic theory of anisotropic normal and superconducting states of Nb. We conclude that pair-breaking in the bulk of niobium films, driven by disorder throughout the film rather than just at the surface, is a significant source of quantum decoherence in transmons. We also conclude that gold capping not only passivates the surface but also affects the properties of the entire film, significantly reducing the scattering rate due to defects likely induced by surface diffusion if the film is not protected immediately after fabrication.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07617v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic Structure of Epitaxial Films of the Bilayer Strontium Ruthenate: Sr$_{3}$Ru$_2$O$_{7}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07747</link><description>arXiv:2602.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on STO are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on LSAT are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling the impact of anti-site defects in magnetic transitions of few-layer MnBi2Te4 by operando heating</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07976</link><description>arXiv:2602.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the first experimentally discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, MnBi2Te4 has attracted widespread attentions, providing a unique platform for the exploration of topological quantum phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state. Despite the increasing number of potential factors affecting samples being identified, obtaining the high-quality device performance with desired topological quantum phases remains a challenge. In this work, by comparing the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) of crystals with different defect densities that are characterized by atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that anti-site defects play an essential role in achieving ideal magnetic states. By measuring RMCD hysteresis loops with operando heating, we find that MnBi2Te4 few-layer samples are highly susceptible to thermal impact, even at temperature as low as 45{\deg}C. The magnetic behavior of heating-treated samples is akin to that of samples fabricated into devices, revealing the thermal impact on devices as well. Starting from few-layers with ideal layer-dependent magnetic order, thermal heating leads to the convergence of magnetization and transition fields between odd- and even-layers. The observed heating-induced magnetic evolution can serve as a valuable reference for assessing the sample quality or the density of anti-site defects. Our findings not only point out the long-standing hidden factor that arose controversies in MnBi2Te4, but also pave the way for controllably engineering the topological quantum phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07976v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Variational Method for Interacting Surfaces with Higher-Form Global Symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08310</link><description>arXiv:2602.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a variational method for interacting surface systems with higher-form global symmetries. As a natural extension of the conventional second-quantized Hamiltonian of interacting bosons, we explicitly construct a second-quantized Hamiltonian formulated in terms of a closed surface operator $\hat{\phi}[C_p^{}]$ charged under a $p$-form global symmetry. Applying the variational principle, we derive a functional Schr\"{o}dinger equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in conventional bosonic systems. In the absence of external forces, the variational equation admits a uniform solution that is uniquely determined by a microscopic interaction potential $U(\psi^*\psi)$ and the chemical potential. This uniform solution describes a uniform gas of bosonic surfaces. Using the obtained energy functional, we show that low-energy fluctuations contain a gapless $p$-form field $A_p^{}$ when the $p$-form global symmetry is $\mathrm{U}(1)$, whereas the $p$-form field becomes massive for discrete symmetries, whose low-energy limit is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory. As a consequence, the system exhibits abelian topological order with anyonic surface excitations. In the presence of external forces, however, solving the functional equation in full generality remains challenging. We argue, however, that the problem reduces to solving the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii equation when external forces act separately on the center-of-mass and relative motions. In addition, we present analytic solutions for topological defects as analogs of vortex and domain-wall solutions in conventional bosonic systems. Finally, as a concrete microscopic model, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ lattice gauge theory and apply our variational method to this system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08310v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] 2D ferroelectric narrow-bandgap semiconductor Wurtzite' type alpha-In2Se3 and its silicon-compatible growth</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08381</link><description>arXiv:2602.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D van der Waals ferroelectrics, particularly alpha-In2Se3, have emerged as an attractive building block for next-generation information storage technologies due to their moderate band gap and robust ferroelectricity stabilized by dipole locking. alpha-In2Se3 can adopt either the distorted zincblende or wurtzite structures; however, the wurtzite phase has yet to be experimental-ly validated, and its large-scale synthesis poses significant challenges. Here, we report an in-situ transport growth of centimeter-scale wurtzite type alpha-In2Se3 films directly on SiO2 substrates using a process combining pulsed laser deposition and chemical vapor deposition. We demonstrate that it is a narrow bandgap ferroelectric semiconductor, featuring a Curie tem-perature exceeding 620 K, a tunable bandgap (0.8-1.6 eV) modulated by charged domain walls, and a large optical absorption coefficient of 1.3 times 10 powers 6 per centemeter. Moreover, light absorption promotes the dynamic conductance range, linearity, and symmetry of the synapse devices, leading to a high recognition accuracy of 92.3 percent in a supervised pattern classification task for neuromorphic computing. Our findings demonstrate a ferroelectric polymorphism of In2Se3, highlighting its potential in ferroelectric synapses for neuromorphic computing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stationary densities in a weakly nonconserving asymmetric exclusion processes with finite resources</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08405</link><description>arXiv:2602.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) along a one-dimensional (1D) open channel sets the paradigm for 1D driven models and nonequilibrium phase transitions in open 1D models. Inspired by the phenomenologies of an open TASEP with Langmuir kinetics (Lk) and with finite resources, we study the stationary densities and phase transitions in a TASEP with Lk connected to a particle reservoir at its both ends. We calculate the stationary density profiles and the phase transitions. The resulting phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters are significantly different from their counterparts in an open TASEP with Lk. In particular, some of the phases admissible in the open TASEP with Lk model are no longer possible. Intriguingly, our model that is closely related to a TASEP coupled with Lk on a ring with a point defect, admits more phases than the latter. Phenomenological implications of our results are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamically entangled oscillating state in a Bose gas with an attractive polaron</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08443</link><description>arXiv:2602.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of an attractively interacting impurity suddenly immersed with a nonzero initial velocity into a system of one-dimensional weakly interacting homogeneous bosons. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in the parameter space. Especially interesting is the relaxation of a fast impurity with a mass close to or exceeding the critical one, where the impurity exhibits undamped temporal long-lived velocity oscillations before reaching a stationary state. The underlying mechanism is the transient localization of a boson depletion cloud near the impurity, that oscillates around the boson density peak situated at the impurity position. The lifetime of this entangled oscillating state increases with the absolute value of the impurity-boson coupling. Cold atomic gases provide an ideal playground where this phenomenon can be probed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08443v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Elastic field causing noncommutativity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08604</link><description>arXiv:2602.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a uniform torsion background, modeling a continuous density of screw dislocations and induces effective spatial noncommutativity and reshapes the energy spectrum of a free quantum particle. Within the geometric theory of defects, the metric yields a first-order (magnetic-like) coupling in the transverse dynamics, equivalent to an effective magnetic field $B_{eff}$ proportional to $p_z Omega$, where $Omega$ encodes the torsion strength. In the strong-coupling (Landau) regime, the planar coordinates obey [x,y] != 0 and the spectrum organizes into Landau-like levels with a slight electric-field-driven tilt and a uniform shift. Thus, increasing $Omega$ drives the system continuously toward the familiar Landau problem in flat space, with torsion setting the noncommutativity scale and controlling the approach to the Landau limit.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08604v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Flash annealing-engineered wafer-scale relaxor antiferroelectrics for enhanced energy storage performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08841</link><description>arXiv:2602.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric capacitors are essential for energy storage systems due to their high-power density and fast operation speed. However, optimizing energy storage density with concurrent thermal stability remains a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a flash annealing process with ultrafast heating and cooling rates of 1000 oC/s, which facilitates the rapid crystallization of PbZrO3 film within a mere second, while locking its high-temperature microstructure to room temperature. This produces compact films with sub-grain boundaries fraction of 36%, nanodomains of several nanometers, and negligible lead volatilization. These contribute to relaxor antiferroelectric film with a high breakdown strength (4800 kV/cm) and large polarization (70 uC/cm2). Consequently, we have achieved a high energy storage density of 63.5 J/cm3 and outstanding thermal stability with performance degradation less than 3% up to 250 oC. Our approach is extendable to ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and on wafer scale, providing on-chip nonlinear dielectric energy storage solutions with industrial scalability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08841v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anisotropy, frustration and saddle point in the twisted Kagome antiferromagnet ErPdPb</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08900</link><description>arXiv:2602.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its inherent geometric frustration, provides a rich platform for exploring intriguing magnetic phenomena and topological electronic structures. In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the N\'eel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link><description>arXiv:2602.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07110v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Markovianity in a dressed qubit with local dephasing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07438</link><description>arXiv:2602.07438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a dressed qubit implemented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites with each site strongly coupled to a bath of phonons. We employ Lang-Firsov transformation to make the problem tractable perturbatively. Applying time-convolutionless master equation within the polaron frame, we investigate decoherence dynamics of the dressed qubit within the singlet-triplet basis of the system for a wide range of bath spectral densities. It is shown that the coherence persists for longer time scales for large coupling values and shows non-monotonic behaviour reflecting the presence of non-Markovianity in the dynamics. Non-Markovianity, characterized by coherence revivals and non-monotonic decay patterns, emerges distinctly depending on the bath spectrum and coupling strengths. Systems coupled to sub-Ohmic baths, whether both or in combination with another type, display pronounced memory effects at relatively small values of couplings. In contrast, combinations involving Ohmic and super-Ohmic baths exhibit noticeable non-Markovianity only at higher couplings.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-active chlorine-related centers in 4H-SiC with telecom-band emissions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08854</link><description>arXiv:2602.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic resonance investigation of a defect in chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC is presented. This Cl-related center emits light at telecom wavelengths with zero-phonon lines in the range 1350-1540 nm. Its four configurations exhibit stable PL spectra characterized by narrow zero-phonon lines. For the two configurations that emit light at the C-band, a Debye-Waller factor in the range 22-25% is estimated. Optically detected magnetic resonance confirms that the Cl-related center is spin active and stable at room temperature with the zero-field splitting in the range of 1.0-1.4 GHz. The combined optical and spin properties suggest this center to be a highly promising candidate for scalable quantum networks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08854v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Stabilized Diffuse-Interface Electroporation Model with a Semi-Analytical Spectral Electrolyte Solver</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03902</link><description>arXiv:1611.03902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1611.03902v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electron-phonon couplings in polymorphous crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09673</link><description>arXiv:2506.09673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positional polymorphism in solids refers to locally disordered unit cells that, on average, reproduce the high-symmetry structures observed in diffraction experiments. Standard theories of electron-phonon interactions fail to describe the temperature-dependent electronic structure of such polymorphous systems. Hybrid halide perovskites are a prime example, where configurational entropy from both polymorphism and molecular disorder plays a central role. Here we generalize the special displacement method to polymorphous crystals, providing an efficient ab initio framework for electron-phonon couplings without resorting to molecular dynamics. We resolve long-standing discrepancies in hybrid halide perovskite physics, including temperature-dependent anharmonic phonons and band gaps. Our approach provides a practical route to link local disorder, configurational entropy, and electron-phonon interactions, with applicability across diverse material classes, from optoelectronics and ferroelectrics to thermoelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.09673v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect engineering spin centers in interacting many-body Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18806</link><description>arXiv:2507.18806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18806v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine-learning interatomic potentials achieving CCSD(T) accuracy for systems with extended covalent networks and van der Waals interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14306</link><description>arXiv:2508.14306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. MLIPs trained on coupled-cluster data, particularly CCSD(T), have emerged as a promising route to achieve chemical accuracy beyond the limits of density functional theory (DFT) and to incorporate non-empirical van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Most existing approaches are, however, still not straightforwardly applicable for systems with extended covalent networks such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) due to the limited availability of CCSD(T) for periodic systems. Here we present a methodology to train MLIPs with CCSD(T) accuracy for these systems. The approach uses the {\Delta}-learning method with a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline. This strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability toward the periodic systems. Dispersion interactions are accounted for by adding vdW-bound multimers in the training set, and the combination with a vdW-aware tight-binding baseline allows the formally local MLIP to attain CCSD(T)-level accuracy even for systems dominated by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional COF composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. The developed methodology opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations for systems with extended covalent networks and vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14306v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] $\textit{Ab initio}$ Theory of Eliminating Surface Oxides of Superconductors with Noble-Metal Encapsulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02914</link><description>arXiv:2509.02914v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: The brownmillerite-type barium indate (Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$) is a potential electrolyte for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in solid oxide fuel cells. Revealing the defect chemistry of this material is key to understanding its ionic and electronic conductivity. In this contribution, we report the existence of oxygen interstitials in a dumbbell configuration, which are also observed in In$_2$O$_3$. Using Density Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented by selected hybrid-functional calculations, we investigate vacancies, various oxygen interstitials, and Frenkel pairs. In doing so, we evaluate the formation energies, charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial pressure. Our results show that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other interstitial configurations exhibit charged states and become the prevailing compensating defects at high oxygen partial pressures, alongside oxygen vacancies. Our results provide a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic defects in barium indate, setting the stage for future investigations of the diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18602v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effect of FABr Over-Stoichiometry on the Morphology and Optoelectronic Properties of Wide-Bandgap FAPbBr_3 Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19158</link><description>arXiv:2511.19158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of formamidinium bromide (FABr) over-stoichiometry in the precursor solution on the optoelectronic properties and morphology of the resulting films of formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr_3). Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.19158v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Structural and Defect Properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22592</link><description>arXiv:2511.22592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.22592v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DFT modelling of stacking faults in hexagonal and cubic GaN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11206</link><description>arXiv:2601.11206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the energetics, and the atomic and electronic structure, of stacking faults in GaN, both in the stable hexagonal wurtzite (wz) phase and in the metastable cubic zincblende (zb) phase. In wz GaN, SFs on the (0001) planes can be divided into three different intrinsic stacking faults (I1, I2, and I3) and oneextrinsic stacking fault (E). In zb GaN, SFs form along (111) directions, giving one type each of intrinsic, extrinsic and twin SFs. Based on the calculated formation energy, I1 is the most stable SF of wz GaN in agreement with experiment. For zb GaN, the intrinsic stacking fault is the most dominant planar defect. To characterize the effect of the stacking faults on the electronic structure of the material, we examined the band density. We found that the bands near the valence band maximum in wz GaN are localised on the Ga-polar side of the stacking fault (i.e. on the Ga side of the Ga-N bonds perpendicular to the SF), with the bands near the conduction band minimum more on the N-polar side, though somewhat delocalised. We found the opposite trend in zb GaN; this behaviour is caused by a redistribution of charge near the interface. We also show the band offsets for the stacking faults, finding that they are very sensitive to local conditions, but can all be described as type II interfaces, with the presence of a stacking fault reducing the gap locally.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11206v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An exciting approach to theoretical spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11388</link><description>arXiv:2601.11388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical spectroscopy, and more generally, electronic-structure theory, are powerful concepts for describing the complex many-body interactions in materials. They comprise a variety of methods that can capture all aspects, from ground-state properties to lattice excitations to different types of light-matter interaction, including time-resolved variants. Modern electronic-structure codes implement either a few or several of these methods. Among them, exciting is an all-electron full-potential package that has a very rich portfolio of all levels of theory, with a particular focus on excitations. It implements the linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital (LAPW+LO) basis, which is known as the gold standard for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory (DFT). Based on this, it also offers benchmark-quality results for a wide range of excited-state methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in exciting in recent years, accompanied by short summaries on the state of the art of the underlying methodologies. They comprise DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) for phonons and electron-phonon coupling, and many-body perturbation theory in terms of the $GW$ approach and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Moreover, exciting can handle resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), pump-probe spectroscopy as well as exciton-phonon coupling (EXPC). Finally, we cover workflows and a view on data and machine learning (ML). All aspects are demonstrated with examples for scientifically relevant materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11388v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric moir\'e heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06656</link><description>arXiv:2602.06656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06656v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sub-nanometer 3D morphometric precision of polarisation-resolved wide-field optical extinction microscopy determines the roundness of individual gold nanospheres</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18696</link><description>arXiv:2512.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we provide a step change by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are modelled for an ellipsoidal particle, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. The material permittivity and surface damping providing the best fit are found. The particle aspect ratio is determined with a precision better than 5%, and the size with an impressive precision of 0.1 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength in the medium. Taking them into account improves the shape accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18696v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link><description>arXiv:2601.22192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22192v2</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Cation-induced lattice modulation effects in efficient CZTSSe solar cells</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061902/3379050/Cation-induced-lattice-modulation-effects-in</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Although Ag single-doping and Ag-Cd co-doping have been demonstrated to enhance the performance of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells, current understanding remains largely confined to defect-level modulation, lacking insight into the microscopic structural reconstruction induced by doping and its fundamental impact on carrier dynamics. By integrating experimental characterization with first-principles calculations, this study reveals a “lattice-modulation” mechanism driven by cation doping. The results show that introduced Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; preferentially occupies Cu sites within the Cu-Sn layers, inducing specific lattice expansion along the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis. This expansion saturates at an Ag/(Cu + Ag) ratio of ∼11%, which aligns precisely with the optimal doping concentration for device efficiency. Such lattice modulation directly optimizes carrier dynamics: first-principles calculations indicate that the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis electron mobility exhibits an extremum near the optimal doping level, while the carrier lifetime is significantly extended. The synergistic improvement in mobility and lifetime increases the diffusion length, thereby suppressing bulk recombination and enhancing charge collection efficiency, ultimately leading to a notable increase in both open-circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, Ag-Cd co-doping demonstrates a unique synergistic effect: Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; occupying Zn sites further drives &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis expansion and enhances &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis electron mobility. This complementary site-occupancy mechanism enables cooperative optimization of both lattice structure and carrier transport, resulting in a champion efficiency of 13.25%. By anchoring the physical origin of performance improvement to observable and computable lattice parameters and carrier dynamics parameters, this work provides a framework for the rational design of high-performance multi-cation solar cells.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061902/3379050/Cation-induced-lattice-modulation-effects-in</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Unveiling the structural, electronic, and optical properties of ATaO 3  (A = K, Rb, Cs) perovskites via DFT calculations</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063303/3379047/Unveiling-the-structural-electronic-and-optical</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Alkali-metal tantalates ATaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (A = K, Rb, Cs) are cubic perovskite oxides whose properties can be tuned by varying the A-site cation.

Structural optimization shows that increasing cation size from K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; expands lattice parameters, elongates Ta–O bonds, and reduces stiffness, with RbTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibiting the highest bulk modulus due to optimal bonding. Band structure analysis reveals a progressive narrowing of bandgaps, with CsTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; displaying a direct bandgap, making it promising for optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: We report detailed Raman spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility studies on the spin-driven ferroelectric compounds Mn4Nb2O9 (MNO) and Mn4Ta2O9 (MTO). Both systems exhibit strong spin-phonon coupling below the short-range magnetic ordering temperature (T(sro)=223 K), followed by further renormalization of several Raman modes at the long-range magnetic ordering temperatures (TN = 120 K for MNO and 110 K for MTO). Pronounced anomalies in Raman mode frequencies and linewidths, along with the emergence of octahedral modes between Tsro and TN, indicate a possible low-symmetry structural transition, more evident in MNO and closely linked to magnetic ordering in MTO. Distinct low-temperature evolutions of Raman mode shift, linewidth, and integrated intensity in MNO and MTO highlight the role of the nonmagnetic B-site cation in tuning spin-lattice coupling, driven by differences in spin-orbit coupling and orbital hybridization between Nb5+ (4d) and Ta5+ (5d). By combining Raman spectroscopy with nuclear magnetic resonance, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, we further show that Mn-based systems possess a more distorted local structure than their Co analogues, while their electronic structures differ despite comparable band gaps. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of spin-lattice coupling in Mn- and Co-based A4B2O9 magnetoelectric systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural Distortions and Ferroelectricity in Antiperovskite Oxides with Tetrel Elements</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06324</link><description>arXiv:2602.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiperovskites share the same structure as perovskites, but allow completely different chemistries and nominal charge states of anions to be stabilized. This gives rise to many interesting phenomena, including septet superconductivity and topological crystalline insulating phases in these systems. Despite this, the work on the crystal structural trends in these compounds are more limited compared to perovskites. In this study, we consider the family of antiperovskite oxides with tetrel elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) and alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, Ba), and perform a detailed study of their crystal structures using first principles density functional theory. We show how tolerance factor arguments can be constructed to predict their structure in a way parallel to the perovskites, and furthermore, how heterostructuring (or cation-order) can be used to induce ferroelectricity in these systems which may provide an experimental knob to modify electronic structure. We conclude by a discussion of the electronic structure of antiperovskites, and show that they display interesting trends not observed in regular perovskites, including significant antibonding interactions between face-center ions, which might need to be taken into account building effective electronic models of these compounds.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric moir\'e heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06656</link><description>arXiv:2602.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06656v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optimized Photoemission from Organic Molecules in 2D Layered Halide Perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06740</link><description>arXiv:2602.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halides have been at the forefront of materials research. Typically, the functional (e.g., optoelectronic) properties of hybrid halides are derived from the inorganic structural part, whereas the organic structural units can add extra advantages in terms of stability, rigidity, and processability. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new hybrid materials in which the outstanding photophysical properties originate from the organic structural part. The new compounds, (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, have 2D layered Ruddlesden-Poppertype perovskite structures. These hybrids are blue-white light emitters just like their corresponding pure organic salts, but with much improved emission efficiencies. Optical spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that photoemission comes from the trans-stilbene organic cations. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of these new materials are among the highest known, 50.83 % and 26.60 % for (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, respectively. This is up to a 5-fold increase as compared to the light emission efficiency of the precursor salt C15H16NCl (PLQY of 10.33 %). Alongside their outstanding optical properties, their environmental and thermal stability allow their consideration for potential practical applications such as radiation detection. This work shows that hybrid metal halides can be compositionally and structurally engineered to have highly efficient photoemission originating from the organic components for fast scintillation applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06740v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Damage accumulation induced metal-insulator transition through ion implantation of ScN thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06757</link><description>arXiv:2602.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion implantation is a powerful approach for tuning the electrical properties of materials through controlled doping and defect engineering, with applications in thermoelectrics and microelectronics. Scandium nitride (ScN) is particularly sensitive to irradiation-induced disorder, with transport properties spanning several orders of magnitude and multiple conduction mechanisms involved. In this study, we investigate the evolution of electrical transport in epitaxial ScN thin films undergoing accumulated irradiation damage at an initial defect state. A phenomenological damage-accumulation model was successfully combined with temperature dependent resistivity and Hall effect measurements to elucidate the impact of defect buildup on electrical transport and to provide physically grounded, quantitative insight into the nature and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. It reveals two distinct defects-generation regimes of electrically active defects. At low doses, direct-impact damage produces stable and isolated acceptor-type complex defects, (VSc-X) with VSc a scandium vacancy and X denoting residual impurities, leading to a gradual increase in resistivity. At higher doses, defect accumulation dominates through a multi-hit process, giving rise to point-defect buildup and carrier localization, resulting in hopping-dominated transport. This localized regime is thermally unstable and recovers upon low-temperature annealing. We further demonstrate that the residual defect landscape strongly influences both the critical dose for the metal-insulator transition and the localization strength: films grown on Al2O3 exhibit an earlier transition and weaker localization than those grown on MgO. These results highlight ion implantation as an effective route for engineering disorder-induced localization in ScN, with the initial film quality playing a decisive role.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06757v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge-$4e$ superconductor with parafermionic vortices: A path to universal topological quantum computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06963</link><description>arXiv:2602.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\nu=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Shallow Trap States Control Electrical Performance of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Thin-Film Transistors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06329</link><description>arXiv:2602.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of n-type amorphous oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) is largely controlled by the density of states (DoS) near the conduction band mobility edge. Here, the full subgap DoS of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs, used in display panels and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) development, is measured by ultrabroadband photoconduction (UP-DoS) microscopy to within 0.1 eV of the mobility edge. The measured subgap DoS for 25 TFT processing conditions accurately predicts each transfer curve, showing how shallow defect states are electron traps that rigidly tune subthreshold swing, threshold voltage and drift mobility. For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks. The dominant trap controlling conventional a-IGZO TFT performance is centered at ~0.32 eV below the conduction band mobility edge and is assigned to a Ga-Ga-In oxygen vacancy defect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00144</link><description>arXiv:2504.00144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, often approximated by an 80:20 ratio, underlies the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning enables the fine-tuning of internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli and ensuring robust performance. Engineered systems with antagonistic interactions remain comparatively unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked to frustration mechanisms in the underlying network. In this context, spin-glass theory has shown how apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic and chaotic behavior can arise from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states that prevent the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we show how topology constrains dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We use the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical structure and the complex energy landscape of the system. This reveals novel and highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of emergent multistability and non-ergodicity in frustrated systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.00144v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards dislocation-driven quantum interconnects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12387</link><description>arXiv:2507.12387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central problem in the deployment of quantum technologies is the realization of robust architectures for quantum interconnects. We propose to engineer interconnects in semiconductors and insulators by patterning spin qubits at dislocations, thus forming quasi one-dimensional lines of entangled point defects. To gain insight into the feasibility and control of dislocation-driven interconnects, we investigate the optical cycle and coherence properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, in proximity of dislocations, using a combination of advanced first-principles calculations. We show that one can engineer spin defects with properties similar to those of their bulk counterparts, including charge stability and a favorable optical cycle, and that NV centers close to dislocations have much improved coherence properties. Finally, we predict optically detected magnetic resonance spectra that may facilitate the experimental identification of specific defect configurations. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the engineering of one-dimensional arrays of spin defects in the solid state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.12387v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08064</link><description>arXiv:2510.08064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (&lt;10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08064v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11058</link><description>arXiv:2601.11058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We map out the global phase diagram of a single mobile impurity in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, spanning the bath evolution from a compressible superfluid (SF) to an incompressible Mott insulator (MI) and the full range of impurity-bath coupling. Using sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we identify two distinct self-trapping mechanisms that organize the entire diagram. In the compressible SF, increasing impurity-bath coupling $|U_{\mathrm{ib}}|$ drives an interaction-driven self-trapping crossover signaled by a collapse of the \emph{impurity} winding number: a light, extended polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a self-trapped state -- a repulsive \emph{saturated bubble} or an attractive \emph{bound cluster} -- even while the bath remains globally superfluid, demonstrating self-trapping without any bath phase transition. By contrast, at fixed $U_{\mathrm{ib}}$ and upon tuning the bath across the SF-MI transition, self-trapping becomes compressibility controlled: the vanishing bath compressibility quenches polaronic dressing and collapses the impurity-centered density response, yielding a nearly free defect near criticality and, deep in the MI, a self-trapped vacancy- or particle-type defect bound to the impurity. In the incompressible regime, this proceeds via \emph{quantized defect formation}, manifested by discrete changes in the total bath occupation. Together, our results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, governed by winding collapse in the SF and by compressibility loss and defect quantization across the SF-MI boundary.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11058v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mobile impurity coupled to correlated lattice bosons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11062</link><description>arXiv:2601.11062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the coherence and spatial dressing of a single impurity evolve in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model when the impurity couples attractively to the bath. Using large-scale, sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we measure the impurity winding, bath superfluid response and compressibility, and impurity-bath density correlations. In a compressible superfluid bath ($U_{\mathrm{b}}/t=13.3$), strengthening attraction drives an interaction-controlled \emph{winding-collapse self-trapping crossover}: a mobile light polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a bound cluster with vanishing winding, while the bath remains globally superfluid. In incompressible Mott-insulating baths, by contrast, extended density rearrangements are suppressed and the dressing cloud collapses; we compare the resulting short-range deformation patterns for both attractive and repulsive couplings. Across the SF-MI transition at fixed moderate attraction ($U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-8.0$), the impurity crosses over from a mobile polaron with an extended deformation cloud to a nearly free defect with minimal dressing in the Mott background; for this coupling it does not lock into a fully self-trapped defect even deep in the insulator. Together with our companion Letter [Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems] on repulsive couplings, these results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, connecting interaction-driven winding collapse in the superfluid to compressibility-controlled undressing across the SF-MI transition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11062v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00169</link><description>arXiv:2602.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00169v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link><description>arXiv:2602.03770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.84522$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes.

However, ScAlN devices have been limited by large E&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and poor endurance. In this work, we report a Ti-assisted surface oxide layer reconstruction approach to enhance the performance of ferroelectric ScAlN. Ti/ScAlN/GaN capacitors were fabricated and subsequently annealed to promote oxygen migration from the native ScAlON into the Ti electrode, forming an insulating TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfacial layer. This reconstruction reduced the polarization switching field and improved device reliability. At an optimized annealing temperature of 400 °C, the capacitors exhibited endurance up to 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cycles with P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; exceeding 60 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In this study, ScAlN films were grown on Si-doped &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;-GaN/AlN/sapphire substrates by sputter epitaxy at growth temperatures of 420–675 °C, and their structural and ferroelectric characteristics were systematically investigated. X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping revealed that the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;-axis lattice constant increased, but the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis lattice constant simultaneously decreased, at growth temperatures above approximately 650 °C, indicating a temperature-induced modification of the ScAlN lattice. Positive-up–negative-down measurements showed a significant leakage current at temperatures above 550 °C, which prevented the saturation of the remanent polarization in the polarization–electric field characteristics. At lower growth temperatures, the films exhibited remanent polarization and coercive fields comparable to those reported for high-quality ScAlN films grown on GaN by molecular-beam epitaxy and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. This result demonstrates that low-temperature sputter epitaxy can reproduce the intrinsic ferroelectric switching behavior of ScAlN. Thus, low-temperature sputter epitaxy effectively suppresses the leakage current and enables reliable ferroelectric switching, providing useful guidelines for optimizing ScAlN deposition processes for ferroelectric device applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/062102/3378908/Structural-and-ferroelectric-properties-of-sputter</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Tuning the phonon dynamics via Sn-resonant impurities assists strong anharmonicity in  p -type Zintl Mg 3 Sb 2</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/064103/3378905/Tuning-the-phonon-dynamics-via-Sn-resonant</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based Zintl compounds are promising &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;-type thermoelectric (TE) materials with a hexagonal crystal structure and are considered promising candidates due to their abundance in nature, low cost, and low toxicity. Here, the Sn-substituted &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;-type Mg&lt;sub&gt;3−x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based solid solution was synthesized via spark plasma sintering, and its transport properties were investigated through experimental and theoretical aspects.

The improved carrier concentration of 1.47  × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and electrical conductivity of 324 S/cm, with the Seebeck coefficient of 133 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;V/K, yielded a maximum power factor of 579.8 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;W/mK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 753 K. Additionally, Sn doping induced lattice disorders, and point defects led to reduced the sound velocity of 2225 m/s, resulting in a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.72 W/mK at 753 K.

Among various materials investigated for neuromorphic devices, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, particularly MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibit promising properties for memristors and memtransistors due to their tunable bandgap, mechanical flexibility, and high surface activity. Although vertical conductive filament (CF) formation in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based devices has been well-documented, the mechanisms governing in-plane CF formation in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remain poorly understood, particularly in the presence of grain boundaries (GBs). In this work, we systematically investigate the role of 4|6 and 5|7 GBs in monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the in-plane formation and migration of copper-based CFs using first-principles density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the 4|6 GB significantly lowers the copper migration energy barrier (1.33 eV) compared to pristine (1.56 eV) and 5|7 GB-containing MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.75 eV). Differential charge density analysis and band structure calculations confirm that GBs enhance binding affinity and modulate local electronic properties, promoting metallic behavior upon Cu incorporation. Molecular dynamics simulations under an applied electric field further reveal that Cu migration and CF formation preferentially occur along the 4|6 GB. These findings provide critical insights into defect-engineered CF modulation and highlight the potential of 4|6 GBs to enhance the performance and reliability of lateral MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; neuromorphic devices.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061601/3378903/Unveiling-the-role-of-grain-boundaries-in-driving</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Time delay as the origin of oscillations in anodic Si electrodissolution</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00334-2?rss=yes</link><description>Silicon is a key semiconductor electrode, and is known for exhibiting oscillations during anodi coxidation in fluoride-containing solutions.

Oscillationsoccur if the following three conditions are met: the etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer, the defect density decreases with increasing electric field at the Si-oxide interface,and a sufficient time delay exists between production and etching of the oxide.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00334-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Noise Fingerprints as a Quantitative Order Parameter for Polarization‐ and Defect‐Mediated Switching in Hafnia Ferroelectrics</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202519391?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 18:10:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202519391</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Identifying and Overcoming the Polaron-Induced Mobility Limit in a 2D Germanium Halide Perovskite</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c18264</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c18264/asset/images/medium/nn5c18264_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c18264&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 17:54:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c18264</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] A Metal‐Free Phthalocyanine Additive for Defect Passivation and Processing Tolerance in High‐Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202512151?af=R</link><description>Small, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 16:55:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202512151</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Polymorphic Polar Ordering Engineered Relaxor Antiferroelectric for High Energy Storage Performance</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202528621?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 08:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202528621</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents] Intrinsic Elastification of Ferroelectric Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Homopolymers</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.4732764?af=R</link><description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 08:58:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/anie.4732764</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Materials] Quantum defects in carbon nanotubes as single-photon sources</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-026-01085-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Materials, Published online: 07 February 2026;

Abstract: Although point defects in hexagonal boron nitride exhibiting single-photon emission attract considerable interest, a broader understanding of defect physics and chemistry in hBN remains limited, potentially hindering further development. Oxygen is among the most common impurities in hBN, and numerous studies have reported a pronounced photoluminescence band centered near 3.5 eV following oxygen incorporation, yet its microscopic origin has remained unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that this emission originates from hole capture by neutral oxygen substituting for nitrogen (ON). The transition mechanism is non-trivial, involving not only a change in charge state but also a substantial structural reconfiguration: the positive and neutral states exhibit markedly different geometries and symmetries. In the neutral state the defect adopts a low-symmetry configuration with out-of-plane displacements of the oxygen and neighboring atoms. The calculated emission energy (3.63 eV) and lineshape are in excellent agreement with experiment.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multi-wavelength Spin Dynamics of Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05301</link><description>arXiv:2602.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spin defects are essential platforms for quantum sensing and information processing. Recently, single spin defects with combined S = 1 and S = 1/2 spin transitions were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). In this work we unveil their excitation dynamics. In particular, we study the effects of the excitation wavelength on the spin-dependent fluorescence and the spin dynamics of these peculiar quantum spin defects. We find that changing the excitation wavelength leads to a threefold enhancement in both the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and the corresponding magnetic field sensitivity. In addition, we find that the excitation wavelength has a strong impact on the photodynamics of spin complex emitters. Our work presents valuable insights to the mechanistic understanding of spin complex emitters in hBN and highlights the importance of excitation wavelength for optimising their performance in quantum sensing and quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectricity in Atomically Thin Metallic TaNiTe$_5$ with Ultrahigh Carrier Density</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05398</link><description>arXiv:2602.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric metals, characterized by the coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallic conductivity, present a fundamental challenge due to the screening effect of free charge carriers on the long-range electric dipole order. Existing strategies to circumvent this obstacle include employing two-dimensional (2D) crystals, where reduced dimensionality and low carrier densities suppress screening, or designing materials of van der Waals (vdW) superlattice with spatially separated and decoupled conductive and nearly insulating ferroelectric layers. Here, we report an alternative paradigm in TaNiTe5, where an ultrahigh carrier density coexists with an out-of-plane ferroelectric order within the same surface monolayer. Using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we observed robust ferroelectric behavior in TaNiTe5 down to single-unit-cell thickness (~1.3 nm) at room temperature. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) gives structural evidence that the ferroelectricity might originate from the vertical displacement of outmost Te atoms on the surface, breaking the inversion symmetry. Concurrently, electrical transport measurements reveal a metallic state with a carrier density on the order of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ (or 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$) -- comparable to that of Copper (Cu). Our findings establish a unique platform for exploring the interplay between ferroelectricity and an ultrahigh density of mobile carriers in the 2D limit.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05398v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferron-Polaritons in Superconductor/Ferroelectric/Superconductor Heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05473</link><description>arXiv:2602.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the formation of ferron-polariton - a hybrid light-matter quasiparticle arising from the coupling between collective ferroelectric excitations (ferrons) and Swihart photons in a superconductor/ferroelectric/superconductor heterostructure. The coupling provides direct evidence for ferrons and reaches the ultrastrong-coupling regime, with a spectral gap in the terahertz range, orders of magnitude larger than those in magnetic analogues, reflecting the superior strength of electric dipole interactions. Our work establishes superconductor-ferroelectric heterostructures as a novel platform for exploring extreme light-matter coupling and for developing high-speed, ferroelectric-based quantum technologies at terahertz frequencies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Suppressed coarsening after an interaction quench in the Holstein chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05815</link><description>arXiv:2602.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by an interaction quench in the semiclassical Holstein model within the Ehrenfest nonadiabatic framework, which describes an isolated hybrid quantum-classical system with strictly conserved total energy. Focusing on the half-filled case, where the equilibrium ground state exhibits commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) order for any nonzero coupling, we identify three distinct post-quench dynamical regimes as a function of the final electron-phonon coupling: a nonequilibrium metallic state without CDW order, an intermediate regime characterized by slow scale-invariant ordering dynamics, and a frozen CDW state with arrested coarsening and immobile kinks. We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation. An effective reaction-diffusion description, incorporating both annihilation and elastic scattering of kinks, quantitatively accounts for the observed scaling behavior. Our results reveal a distinct coarsening mechanism in isolated hybrid systems, demonstrating how internal quantum dynamics can qualitatively reshape defect kinetics far from equilibrium.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05815v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Low-temperature spin dynamics in LAFO thin films: from cubic anisotropy to TLS-limited coherence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05889</link><description>arXiv:2602.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-temperature spin dynamics of epitaxial lithium aluminum ferrite (LAFO) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy from 0.44 K to 68 K. The results reveal a crossover from conventional cubic anisotropy-dominated behavior at higher temperatures to pronounced linewidth broadening and higher-order anisotropy contributions at cryogenic temperatures. With the magnetic field oriented along the [100] crystallographic direction, the resonance is well-captured by four-fold in-plane and out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropies. In contrast, measurements with the field along the [110] direction reveal the presence of an unusually large sixth-order cubic anisotropy term that is symmetry-suppressed for [100] but becomes apparent under this field orientation at ultralow temperatures, indicating a substantial modification of the anisotropy landscape. Independent linewidth analysis shows a pronounced peak near 8 K and a subtle monotonic enhancement with decreasing temperatures below 2 K, features consistent with dissipation mediated by a bath of two-level systems (TLS) arising from antisite defects and localized Fe$^{3+}$ moments. Comparison with TLS-based models demonstrates that both exchange-coupled impurities and nearly free paramagnetic centers contribute to the observed damping. Our results establish LAFO as a model ferrite system where disorder-induced TLS limit spin coherence at ultralow temperatures, providing new insights into anisotropy engineering, magnetic relaxation, and the design of ferrimagnetic insulators for coherent magnonics. These findings offer a framework for future optimization of growth conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05889v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optimization of random phase approximation calculations for improved energies of molecules, solids, and surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05138</link><description>arXiv:2602.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimized random phase approximation method (optRPA26) that significantly improves upon conventional RPA. The method employs an empirically constructed hybrid functional to generate DFT orbitals to evaluate the RPA correlation energy, which is then scaled by a constant. Comprehensive benchmarks across molecules, bulk solids, and surface systems demonstrate that optRPA26 consistently achieves high accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 0.05 eV for W4-11 reaction energies, 0.07 eV for cohesive energies, 0.09 eV for metal oxide formation energies, 0.11-0.12 eV for adsorption of small molecules on metals, and 0.06 eV for adsorption on oxides. In addition, optRPA26 correctly captures phase stability in metal oxides and magnetic metals. The optRPA26 approach can be run using standard RPA implementations, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose reference method that can accurately capture covalent, ionic, and metallic, and van der Waals bonding in molecules, solids, and interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05138v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sub-nm2 ferroelectric domains via charged 180 degree walls in ZrO2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18920</link><description>arXiv:2507.18920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat phonon bands in fluorite ferroelectrics (HfO2 or ZrO2) shrink polar domains laterally to an irreducible half-unit-cell width (0.27 nm) within which the vertical arrangement of dipoles is expected to remain uniform. We report on the direct observation of nonuniform and nearly discrete vertical arrangements of dipoles in ZrO2 thin films consisting of closely spaced head-to-head (HH) and tail-to-tail (TT) charged 180 degree walls, each exhibiting a distinct bulk-like structure. These charged domain walls (CDWs) further compress the irreducibly narrow, laterally stacked domains vertically to a thickness of 1-2.75 nm, yielding in-plane domains with sub-nm2 footprints-among the smallest ever reported for any ferroelectric material. The HH and TT walls form due to their flat longitudinal optical (LO) polar bands and are electrostatically stabilized by bound-charge compensation via interstitial oxygen atoms, which act as natural structural defects at the HH walls. Moreover, these walls are predicted to be conducting and to exhibit ultralow propagation barriers, with HH walls (1.6 meV) being far more mobile than TT walls (22.3 meV), indicating strong potential for low-voltage, domain-wall-based nanoelectronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18920v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic behavior of $5d^1$ Re-based double perovskite Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04071</link><description>arXiv:2509.04071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions, and cation ordering can lead to exotic magnetic states in transition-metal ions. We report a comprehensive study of the Re-based (5$d^1$) ordered double perovskite oxide Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD reveals that Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) at low temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition below $\sim$13 K, with $M$--$H$ loops showing ferromagnetic-like hysteresis and an unusually high coercive field of 23 kOe at 2 K. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements detect static and spatially disordered internal fields below $T_M \simeq $ 12 K, consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic ground state determined by detailed DFT and force-theorem in Hubbard-I calculations. The reduced high-temperature effective moment ($\sim0.76~\mu_B$) and very small static moment ($\lesssim 0.2~\mu_B$) derived from $\mu$SR analysis and local-field simulations indicate a decisive role of spin-orbit coupling. Through a combined experimental and computational approach we unambiguously determine the canted antiferromagnetic order in Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$, showing that a very small ordered moment coexists with an exceptionally large coercivity. These results underscore the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and orbital ordering, providing new insights into magnetism in 5$d^1$ double perovskites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04071v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16474</link><description>arXiv:2511.16474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic inorganic semiconductors are promising candidates for high-performance stable flexible electronics. Germanium-based chalcogenide materials are well-known for excellent semiconducting properties, notably superior carrier mobility. However, the intrinsic half-bond nature of metavalent bonds between Ge atoms and chalcogens accounts for their inherent brittleness. Here, we report an ultra-high plasticity germanium-based chalcogenide of GaGeTe. GaGeTe single crystals can sustain a large engineering strain up to 7.5% without fracture. Through a comprehensive multi-scale investigation ranging from macroscopic characterization to atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that the exceptional plasticity is due to a synergistic effect of interlayer gliding and intralayer lattice distortion. DFT calculations further elucidate the chemical origin. The existence of Ga atoms avoids the formation of brittle metavalent Ge-Te bonds. Instead, a robust honeycomb lattice formed by sp3-hybridized covalent Ga-Te, Ge-Ge, and Ga-Ge bonds preserves high bond strength under large tensile strains in simulations, thereby underpinning the macroscopic plastic behavior. This systematic study on the origin of the plasticity in GaGeTe introduces bond engineering as a potential approach for constructing plastic inorganic semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16474v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic States, Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetism in Germanium 60{\deg} Dislocations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04469</link><description>arXiv:2602.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors have recently attracted renewed interest owing to their potential in novel quantum applications. Here we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties induced by 60{\deg} dislocations in Ge. Using large-scale DFT calculations, we determine the band structure for both the shuffle and glide sets in their lowest-energy configurations. We also perform charged-defect calculations to aid in the interpretation of complex photoluminescence spectra observed in epitaxial Ge layers. The band structure for the shuffle set reveals defect-induced dispersive bands localized within the band gap near the {\Gamma} point, whereas for the glide set, we observe strong overlap with the conduction band. Defect-induced band splitting evident away from {\Gamma} reveals Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, an effect previously reported only for screw dislocations. Remarkably, we find evidence that specific dislocation arrangements can stabilize antiferromagnetic ordering with sizable local magnetic moments and considerable exchange splitting between opposite spin states. These results uncover rich physics in Ge dislocations through the combination of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic ordering, potentially enabling novel defect-based functionalities in Ge devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04469v2</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Promising ferroelectric metal EuAuBi with switchable giant shift current</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01990-6</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 06 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01990-6"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01990-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Promising ferroelectric metal EuAuBi with switchable giant shift current</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01990-6</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Pannexin 1a Regulates Visual System Development and Ocular Integrity in Zebrafish</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00300-7?rss=yes</link><description>Pannexin 1a (Panx1a), a large-pore ATP release channel broadly expressed in the vertebrate eye, has an unclear role in ocular development.

Abstract: Understanding defects in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors is essential for advancing their use in next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Here, we apply a combination of various impedance spectroscopy techniques to two-dimensional (2D) vdW GaSe doped with silicon (Si) to reconstruct deep trap states across the full bandgap. Deep-level transient spectroscopy reveals three distinct deep states 0.31, 0.88, and 1.40 eV below the conduction band edge. Complementary deep-level optical spectroscopy and photocapacitance measurements identify three deep states at 1.4 and 1.8 eV below the conduction band edge, and 2.0 eV above the valence band edge, with thermal admittance spectroscopy providing additional verification and further resolving two trap states, at 0.16 eV above the valence band edge and at 0.26 eV below the conduction band edge. By comparing the experimentally extracted ionization energies with the predictions of density functional theory, our results attribute these trap states primarily to Si-related defects and metal vacancies. This work presents a comprehensive defect map of Si-doped GaSe, providing critical insights into carrier trapping mechanisms that are essential for optimizing the design of 2D material-based devices for industrial applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03964v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Decoupling effects of the resistive-switching behavior on the polarization reversal in ultrathin ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04133</link><description>arXiv:2602.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HfO2-based ferroelectric films have attracted considerable attention as their nanoscale ferroelectricity and compatibility with cmos technology, fulfilling demands of emerging memory technologies. However, as films scale down, resistive-switching behavior becomes increasingly pronounced, intricately intertwining with the polarization-switching process and affecting ferroelectric switching factors often overlooked yet crucial for device performance optimization. By characterizing resistive-switching behavior and oxygen vacancy motion using tailored electric pulse schemes, we decouple the resistive-switching behavior from the overall switching process in ultrathin ferroelectric HZO films, which would otherwise erroneously inflate polarization values and increase coercive fields. Building on this, we elucidate endurance degradation mechanisms from dual perspectives of resistive switching and defect migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the mitigated resistive switching activity by designing HfO2-based devices with symmetric oxide electrodes, achieving reduced coercive fields and improved cycling performances. This work provides crucial insights into the origins of inflated polarizations and reliability challenges in HfO2-based devices while offering a viable strategy to enhance ferroelectric properties for advanced memory applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic States, Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetism in Germanium 60{\deg} Dislocations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04469</link><description>arXiv:2602.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors have recently attracted renewed interest owing to their potential in novel quantum applications. Here we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties induced by 60{\deg} dislocations in Ge. Using large-scale DFT calculations, we determine the band structure for both the shuffle and glide sets in their lowest-energy configurations. We also perform charged-defect calculations to aid in the interpretation of complex photoluminescence spectra observed in epitaxial Ge layers. The band structure for the shuffle set reveals defect-induced dispersive bands localized within the band gap near the {\Gamma} point, whereas for the glide set, we observe strong overlap with the conduction band. Defect-induced band splitting evident away from {\Gamma} reveals Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, an effect previously reported only for screw dislocations. Remarkably, we find evidence that specific dislocation arrangements can stabilize antiferromagnetic ordering with sizable local magnetic moments and considerable exchange splitting between opposite spin states. These results uncover rich physics in Ge dislocations through the combination of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic ordering, potentially enabling novel defect-based functionalities in Ge devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04469v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microscopic Origin of Polarization-Controlled Magnetization Switching in FePt/BaTiO$_3$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04500</link><description>arXiv:2602.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric-field driven magnetization switching in FePt/BaTiO$_3$ (001) is demonstrated through first-principles calculations. The magnetic easy axis of FePt layer undergoes a transition from in-plane to perpendicular direction upon ferroelectric polarization reversal, a process sensitively controlled by epitaxial strain with threshold strain strain($\eta$) $\eta\approx\%$. At this phenomena, a large interfacial magnetoelectric coupling ($\alpha_I = 3.6 \times 10^{-10}$ G$\cdot$cm$^2$/V) is responsible, stemming from the orbital reconstruction. In particular, the redistribution of Pt-$d$ orbital occupancy alters spin-orbit coupling, thereby tuning the competition between magnetic anisotropy ($K_i$) and magnetoelastic energy ($b_1$). Our work clarifies the fundamental physics of strain-engineered magnetoelectricity and suggests a concrete pathway for designing ultra-low-power voltage-controlled magnetic memory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Triple Junctions as Dislocation-Like Defects: The Role of Grain Boundary Crystallography Revealed by Experiment and Atomistic Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04530</link><description>arXiv:2602.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary networks and their evolution are strongly influenced by triple junctions. The defect nature of these line defects significantly affects the properties of the network, but they have not been fully characterized to date. Here, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with atomistic computer simulations to investigate a triple junction at the atomic scale in an Al thin film with {111} texture. Using sampling methods, we were able to construct the same junction structure as in the experiment within a computer model. We present a technique to calculate the Burgers vector of the triple junction. This allows us to connect the junction's dislocation character to the microscopic degrees of freedom of the joining grain boundaries. The junction line energy in the computer model can then be calculated using an embedded atom method potential. It follows the same laws as a bulk dislocation. Finally, we discovered a range of possible triple junctions for the observed grain boundaries, which vary in the magnitude of their Burgers vector. Interestingly, the experimentally observed junction is not the one with the smallest possible Burgers vector and energy. This suggests that the kinetics of transforming the junction line are likely too slow to be driven by the small energy contribution of the triple junction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cross-sectional helium irradiation reveals interface-controlled bubble evolution in Cr/CrAlSiN multilayer coatings on zirconium alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04615</link><description>arXiv:2602.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irradiation stability of Cr based protective coatings on zirconium alloys is critical for the development of accident-tolerant fuel claddings. However, conventional surface irradiation often produces shallow, nonuniform damage, obscuring interfacial behavior. In this study, we perform cross-sectional He irradiation to directly examine the interfacial response and He bubble evolution across Cr monolayer and Cr and CrAlSiN multilayer coatings on Zr substrates. Irradiation was carried out at 500 C and 750 C to doses of 2 and 3 dpa, enabling a direct comparison of temperature-dependent microstructural evolution. In the Cr monolayer, He implantation produced a homogeneous distribution of nanoscale bubbles throughout the damaged region and large cavities at the Cr and Zr interface, indicating severe Kirkendall-type voiding and interfacial decohesion at elevated temperature. In contrast, the Cr/CrAlSiN multilayer exhibited a periodically modulated bubble distribution, with bubble fragmentation and transformation into nanoscale platelets at CrAlSiN interfaces. A N-enriched Zr(N) interlayer formed spontaneously at the CrAlSiN and Zr interface, effectively suppressing bubble accumulation and interdiffusion. The nanochannel interfaces acted as He sinks and diffusion barriers, enhancing interfacial bonding and mitigating swelling. This work demonstrates that cross-sectional ion irradiation is a powerful approach for probing interfacial stability in multilayer systems, offering new insights into He-defect interactions and radiation tolerance engineering at buried interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of Cr and CrAlSiN multilayers as advanced coating architectures for high-temperature nuclear environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04615v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Indium selenides for next-generation low-power computing devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12708</link><description>arXiv:2503.12708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (&gt;2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.12708v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07187</link><description>arXiv:2508.07187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07187v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Point defects and their dynamic behaviors in silver monolayer intercalated between graphene and SiC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10368</link><description>arXiv:2511.10368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point defects give rise to sharp modifications in the structures and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, offering an atomic-level platform for fundamental studies and potential applications. In this work, we investigate atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated between epitaxial graphene and SiC using scanning tunneling microscopy. Dark and bright defects are identified as vacancies or substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state. Remarkably, under tunneling electron excitation at negative bias, the bright defects exhibit dynamic behaviors characterized by inelastic switching between two states. The switching can be reversibly controlled by the microscope tip, enabling the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Analysis of defect switching reveals possible defect origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. Our findings establish a pathway to precise manipulation of defects in two-dimensional metals and uncover previously unexplored dynamics with potential use in nanoelectronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.10368v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Routes to the density profile and structural inconsistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10433</link><description>arXiv:2511.10433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is the primary method for investigations of inhomogeneous fluids in external fields. It requires the excess Helmholtz free energy functional as input to an Euler-Lagrange equation for the one-body density. A variant of this methodology, the force-DFT, uses instead the Yvon-Born-Green equation to generate density profiles. It is known that the latter are consistent with the virial route to the thermodynamics, while DFT is consistent with the compressibility route. In this work we will show an alternative DFT scheme using the Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim (LMBW) equation to obtain density profiles, that are shown to be also consistent with the compressibility route. However, force-DFT and LMBW DFT can both be implemented using a closure relation on the level of the two-body correlation functions. This is proven to be an advantageous feature, opening the possibility of an optimisation scheme in which the structural inconsistency between different routes to the density profile is minimized. (Structural inconsistency is a generalization of the notion of thermodynamic inconsistency, familiar from bulk integral equation studies.) Numerical results are given for the density profiles of two-dimensional systems of hard-core Yukawa particles with a repulsive or an attractive tail, in planar geometry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.10433v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link><description>arXiv:2602.03770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03770v2</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Electroresponsive AIE polymers for in situ ion-triggered passivation and corrosion visualization in coolant systems</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(26)00008-1?rss=yes</link><description>Li et al. report a smart polymer that uses corrosion-generated ions to autonomously self-assemble into fluorescent, protective films at defect sites.

To address this issue, we investigate the role of electron and hole injection in defect creation in a-Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Our Density Functional Theory calculations demonstrate that electrons and holes can be trapped in polaron and bipolaron states at structural precursor sites in a-Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The bipolaron creation significantly reduces the average energies for the formation of Frenkel pairs (FPs) of oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen ions to about 1.4 eV for hole trapping and 3.2 eV for electron trapping. The average diffusion barriers of the O interstitials are 0.3 eV for O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.4 eV for O&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, which forms a bond with a neighboring O ion at the site. Our results predict that hole bipolaron formation provides the lowest energy pathways for FP creation in stoichiometric a-Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

This study shows that spin coating octylammonium iodide (OAI) onto electrodeposition-converted PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursors results in significantly enhanced device performance and stability. The optimized OAI modification increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 18.38% to 21.21%, with simultaneous improvements in fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;), and short-circuit current density (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;). The OAI-modified devices retain 84% of their initial PCE after 1032 h in an N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; glovebox, far exceeding the stability of control devices (whose PCE decreases to 76% within 312 h). Systematic characterization reveals that OAI first interacts with undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forming an OA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate phase that templates perovskite growth. This process yields enlarged grains, eliminates parasitic PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aggregates, and enhances the crystallinity of perovskite. Then, the residual OAI molecules passivate key defects (undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and halides) at grain boundaries and interfaces via chemical interaction and steric stabilization effects. This results in significantly reduced trap density, suppressed nonradiative recombination, and enhanced charge extraction kinetics. The combination of optimized morphology, superior crystallinity, and effective defect suppression yields simultaneous improvements in all photovoltaic parameters (PCE, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;, FF), along with unprecedented operational stability for electrodeposited perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: The coupling of atomic vibrations to electronic excitations - traditionally understood to be a source of energy loss in semiconductors - has recently been explored in photosynthetic light harvesting as a means to circumvent dissipation by harnessing quantum vibronic coherence. Motivated by recent photocurrent measurements of vibronic sidebands in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ optoelectronic devices, we present a nonperturbative theoretical framework for phonon-assisted absorption in van der Waals heterostructures. Using a polaron transformation, a closed-form expression for the optical absorption spectrum at arbitrary temperatures is presented. Our model includes both intraband and interband electron--phonon coupling. Detailed analysis shows that the observed periodic sidebands originate from the strong coupling between interlayer excitons and nearly dispersionless optical phonon modes. Comparing two limiting cases - one involving only intraband couplings, and another incorporating coherent interband processes - we show that interband phonon-assisted transitions are needed to account for the observed data. Beyond enabling the direct estimation of vibronic coupling strengths from spectroscopic data, these findings have profound consequences for our understanding of optical and optoelectronic responses: coherent interband coupling of atomic vibrations to excitons is essential to quantifying photoresponse in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing Short- and Long-range Li-ion diffusion in Li$_2$MnO$_3$ from finite-temperature dynamical mean field theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02807</link><description>arXiv:2602.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li$_2$MnO$_3$ remains a crucial component of the Li-excess layered cathode family, $(1-x)\,\mathrm{LiMO_2} + x\,\mathrm{Li_2MnO_3}$ ($M$ = Mn, Ni, Co, \dots), but its role in limiting Li-ion mobility remains under debate. Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $\mu^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric dynamic-field-driven nucleation and growth model for predictive materials-to-circuit co-design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02957</link><description>arXiv:2602.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real ferroelectric devices operate under mixed and distorted time-varying voltages, yet the standard nucleation-growth frameworks used to interpret ferroelectric switching -- most notably the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) and nucleation-limited switching models (NLS) -- are derived under the critically limiting assumption of a constant electric field. Thus, the prevailing interpretation of ferroelectric switching dynamics fails under real operating conditions. Here we introduce a compact dynamic-field-driven nucleation and growth (DFNG) model that enables quantitative fits to switching transients across multiple ferroelectric materials to extract time-varying domain wall velocity and growth dimensionality, even under arbitrary voltage waveform. This capability then motivates its use in device modeling under complex signals spanning disparate time and frequency scales. Coupling the compact model to application-related waveforms facilitates a predictive materials-circuit co-design framework by linking nucleation and growth parameters to memory window, disturb error, speed, and energy dissipation for next-generation ferroelectric technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02957v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning current flow in superconducting thin film strips by control wires.

Abstract: It is shown that integration of a thin film superconducting strip with current-carrying control wires enables one to engineer a profile of supercurrent density $J(x)$ with no current crowding at the edges of a strip wider than the magnetic Pearl length $\Lambda$. Moreover, $J(x)$ in a strip can be tuned by control wires to produce an inverted $J(x)$ profile with dips at the edges to mitigate current crowding at lithographic defects and block premature penetration of vortices. These conclusions are corroborated by calculations of $J(x)$ in a thin strip coupled inductively with side control wires or in bilayer strip structures by solving the London and Ginzburg Landau equations in the thin film Pearl limit. Thermally-activated penetration of vortices from the edges and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs in inverted $J(x)$ profiles are evaluated. It is shown that these structures can be used to develop single-photon strip detectors much wider than $\Lambda$. Such detectors can be tuned {\it in situ} by varying current in control wires to reach the ultimate photon sensitivity limited by unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs. The structures considered here also exhibit a non-reciprocal current response and behave as superconducting diodes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Single-Atom Adsorption on h-BN along the Periodic Table of Elements: From Pristine Surface to Vacancy-Engineered Sites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03424</link><description>arXiv:2602.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption of single atoms on pristine and defected hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was systematically investigated using density functional theory. Elements from the first three rows of the periodic table, together with selected transition and coinage metals, were examined on the pristine surface and at boron- and nitrogen-vacancy sites. On pristine h-BN, adsorption is generally weak and dominated by dispersion forces, with measurable chemisorption limited to highly electronegative atoms such as C, O, and F. The introduction of vacancies transforms h-BN into a chemically active material, increasing adsorption energies by one to two orders of magnitude. The boron vacancy strongly stabilizes metallic and electropositive species through coordination to undercoordinated nitrogen atoms, whereas the nitrogen vacancy selectively binds electronegative and covalent adsorbates. Scaling of adsorption energies with elemental cohesive energies distinguishes regimes of physisorption, chemisorption, and substitutional stabilization. These insights provide a unified description of adsorption trends across the periodic table and establish defect engineering as an effective strategy for tailoring the catalytic, sensing, and electronic properties of h-BN.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acceleration of Atomistic NEGF: Algorithms, Parallelization, and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03438</link><description>arXiv:2602.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Evidence for Many-Body States in NiPS$_3$ Revealed by Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03600</link><description>arXiv:2602.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\mu$-ARPES spectra of the Mott-insulating van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Signatures of strong correlations- such as the onset of atomic or atomic-ligand multiplets and spin-orbit-entangled exciton have been observed in this material by various two-particle spectroscopies, but not previously in photoemission. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive feature at the valence-band edge that is absent in DFT+$U$ calculations and remains unchanged across the N\'eel transition. After critically examining and ruling out alternative interpretations, we show that an exact diagonalization of a NiS$_6$ cluster yields low-energy final-state configurations of mixed multiplet $d^7$ and $d^8\underline{L}$ character, whose energy differences are consistent with the observed additional feature. This implies that ARPES directly accesses local Ni-S multiplet physics in NiPS$_3$, revealing a many-body structure beyond mean-field theory. Our results confirm that NiPS$_3$ is an excellent model platform in which strong correlations, reduced dimensionality, and covalent metal-ligand bonding jointly shape both two- and single-particle spectroscopies, underscoring the need for a genuinely quantum many-body description of two-dimensional quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link><description>arXiv:2602.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Polytype-Dependent Upconversion Photoluminescence in 3R-MoS2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03780</link><description>arXiv:2602.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric van der Waals materials offer switchable polarization states, yet optical readout of their stacking configurations remains challenging. Building on the resonant exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) mechanism in 2H-phase TMDs, we report the first observation of upconversion photoluminescence (UPL) in rhombohedral MoS2 and demonstrate that this many-body process is strongly polytype-dependent. Using low-temperature spectroscopy, we observe anti-Stokes emission with superlinear power dependence. Beyond serving as a layer-number sensor, UPL provides a sensitive probe of stacking order. Trilayer ABA and BAB polytypes, indistinguishable by surface potential measurements and second harmonic generation, exhibit markedly different UPL intensities, and this persists in thicker samples. First-principles calculations attribute this polytype dependence to modulation of the Gamma-point conduction manifold, which controls energy-matching conditions for the annihilation process. Power-dependent spectroscopy further disentangles two distinct annihilation channels originating from different dark exciton valleys, identified through their contrasting intensity scaling and opposite density-induced energy shifts. Crucially, the annihilation process doubles the energy separation of nearly degenerate dark excitons while converting their weak emission into bright signal, providing experimental access to valley-specific responses that are obscured in direct dark-exciton spectroscopy. Our findings demonstrate that ferroelectric configurations provide a new degree of freedom for controlling nonlinear optical processes, with implications for all-optical ferroelectric readout and electrically switchable wavelength conversion in two-dimensional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03780v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vacancy defects in square-triangle tilings and their implications for quasicrystals formed by square-shoulder particles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03813</link><description>arXiv:2602.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all observed square-triangle quasicrystals in soft-matter systems contain a large number of point-like defects, yet the role these defects play in stabilizing the quasicrystal phase remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic role of such defects in the widely observed 12-fold symmetric square-triangle quasicrystal. We develop a new Monte Carlo simulation to compute the configurational entropy of square-triangle tilings augmented to contain two types of irregular hexagons as defect tiles. We find that the introduction of defects leads to a notable entropy gain, with each defect contributing considerably more than a conventional vacancy in a periodic crystal. Intriguingly, the entropy gain is not simply due to individual defect types but isamplified by their combinatorial mixing. We then apply our findings to a microscopic model of core-corona particles interacting via a square-shoulder potential. By combining the configurational entropy with vibrational free-energy calculations, we predict the equilibrium defect concentration and confirm that the quasicrystalline phase contains a higher concentration of point-defects than a typical periodic crystal. These results provide a new understanding of the prominence of observed defects in soft-matter quasicrystals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03813v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Evolution of Lying in a Spatially-Explicit Prisoner's Dilemma Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02587</link><description>arXiv:2602.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present the results from a spatial model of the prisoner's dilemma, played on a toroidal lattice. Each individual has a default strategy of either cooperating ($C$) or defecting ($D$). Two strategies were tested, including ``tit-for-tat'' (TFT), in which individuals play their opponent's last play, or simply playing their default play. Each individual also has a probability of telling the truth ($0 \leq P_{truth} \leq 1$) about their last play. This parameter, which can evolve over time, allows individuals to be, for instance, a defector but present as a cooperator regarding their last play. This leads to interesting dynamics where mixed populations of defectors and cooperators with $P_{truth} \geq 0.75$ move toward populations of truth-telling cooperators. Likewise, mixed populations with $P_{truth} &lt; 0.7$ become populations of lying defectors. Both such populations are stable because they each have higher average scores than populations with intermediate values of $P_{truth}$. Applications of this model are discussed with regards to both humans and animals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02587v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Triggered ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ from hybrid phonons and higher-order dynamical charges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08633</link><description>arXiv:2502.08633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ has emerged as a highly promising material for high-density nonvolatile memory and nanoscale transistor applications. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO$_2$ limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. Ferroelectricity, the emergence of a spontaneous and switchable polarization in solids, is conventionally understood to be governed by unstable structural modes (phonons), arising either directly from an unstable polar phonon or indirectly through coupling of unstable nonpolar phonons with a polar mode. While these 'proper' and 'improper' mechanisms successfully explain ferroelectricity for most systems, they do not encompass all possible phenomena. Here, we present a novel mechanism of 'hybrid-triggered' ferroelectricity, where a polar order emerges through trilinear coupling without any structural instabilities. Our group theoretical analysis starting from a high-symmetry reference structure shows that this mechanism is realized in intensely-debated ferroelectric HfO$_2$, along with quantitative confirmation from first-principles calculations. We also show that dynamical charges in this material are highly unconventional, and a significant contribution to the total polarization arises solely from high-order couplings of nonpolar phonons. These findings underline that even simple crystal structures can host surprisingly complicated interplay between different structural orders, elucidate the origin of ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity in fluorite-related structures, and provide foundational understanding for designing superior ferroelectric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.08633v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microscopic theory of Chern polarization via crystalline defect charge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17735</link><description>arXiv:2502.17735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example. Defining polarization for them is complicated because they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center, obtained from the Zak phase, is no longer gauge invariant. In this article, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations. Our expression can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. It is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.17735v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13960</link><description>arXiv:2510.13960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an unconventional phase transition in ferroelectrics where the polarization field is constrained to be divergence-free, allowing only loop-like configurations. This local constraint fundamentally alters the critical behavior, driving the system beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. A renormalization group analysis shows that the polarization acquires an unusually large anomalous dimension, $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions, far exceeding the typical values in $O(3)$-invariant systems. We attribute this effect to a naturally induced gauge symmetry originating from the zero divergence constraint. Such gauge-field behavior is reminiscent of fractionalized phases, revealing a fundamental connection between constrained ferroelectrics and emergent gauge phenomena in correlated matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.13960v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fabrication and Structural Analysis of Trilayers for Tantalum Josephson Junctions with Ta$_2$O$_5$ Barriers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20114</link><description>arXiv:2510.20114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which may host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects, which are the key contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction (JJ) barriers in most qubit architectures. Here, we investigate techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum films to develop tantalum-oxide JJ barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, and plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, characterize the resulting structures using X-ray techniques and electron microscopy, and propose a mechanistic picture of the oxidation pathways. We find that plasma oxidation provides the smoothest Ta$_2$O$_5$ layers, is compatible with in situ Ta deposition, and offers thickness control through the annealing temperature, advantageous for JJ fabrication. Lastly, we evaluate methods for growing Ta/TaO$_x$/Ta trilayers. All trilayers showed c-axis-oriented columnar growth of the bottom Ta layer, with sapphire substrates producing larger, better-aligned grains yet higher dislocation densities than silicon. Nucleation of c-axis-oriented $\alpha$-Ta on tantalum-oxide required an Nb seed layer, as direct Ta deposition yielded amorphous Ta. These results demonstrate the feasibility of $\alpha$-Ta/Nb/TaO$_x$/$\alpha$-Ta stacks for JJs with clean interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.20114v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07457</link><description>arXiv:2512.07457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07457v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10835</link><description>arXiv:2510.10835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10835v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Imaging the sub-moiré potential using an atomic single&amp;#xa0;electron transistor</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10085-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 04 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10085-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-025-10085-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An atomic single electron transistor, which utilizes a single atomic defect in a van der Waals material as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential sensor, is used to image the electrostatic potential within a moiré unit cell.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10085-z</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Redox Potential Prediction of Fe(II)/Fe(III) Complexes: A Density Functional Theory and Graph Neural Network Approach</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00431D</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00431D, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fakhrul Hasan Bhuiyan, Hassan Harb, Rajeev Surendran Assary, Álvaro Vázquez-Mayagoitia&lt;br /&gt;This work presents an integrated computational approach that combines tight-binding density functional theory (DFT) with standard DFT calculations to accurately compute the redox potential of micro-solvated iron-based transition metal complexes....&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00431D</guid></item><item><title>[APL Energy Current Issue] Computationally guided design of graphene-like 2D-membranes for selective proton transport in hydrogen fuel cells</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/4/1/016102/3378553/Computationally-guided-design-of-graphene-like-2D</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;This work investigates proton conduction through a wide range of 2D graphene-like crystals using density functional theory calculations. Our goal focused on understanding the impact of the membrane’s chemical constitution on proton permeability, with particular attention to the effect of sequential substitution using non-metallic elements such as boron, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus. Results indicate that boron-doped graphene reduces the proton permeation energy barrier, being comparable with values for hexagonal boron nitride. In contrast, nitrogen-doped graphene exhibits a significantly high energy barrier (&amp;gt;4 eV) for proton permeation, suggesting that it is unlikely to support proton conduction at room temperature without having defects on the 2D-monolayer. The use of other elements (O, Si, S, and P) generates a broad spectrum of energy barriers, with distinct trends correlating to changes in pore size driven by the elongation or contraction of the 6-membered rings containing the dopants. In comparison, pure 2D-materials such as phosphorene, silicene, and germanene also arise as promising candidates for proton exchange membrane (PEM) applications due to relatively low proton permeation barriers. However, the increased pore size in these materials may reduce their impermeability to other gases, potentially affecting the performance of the PEM. In addition, we further examined the synergistic effects of multi-element 2D materials, with gallium nitride emerging as a candidate capable of simultaneously enhancing proton permeability and improving membrane mechanical and thermal robustness. This work highlights the importance of exploring additional hetero-doped 2D-materials, where untapped chemical properties may offer further opportunities for optimizing PEM performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Energy Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/4/1/016102/3378553/Computationally-guided-design-of-graphene-like-2D</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Synergetic impact of energy transfer and site preference for enhanced emission in Mn-doped Cs 2 AgInCl 6  double perovskite</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/051903/3378623/Synergetic-impact-of-energy-transfer-and-site</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Strategic doping in halide double perovskites, with structure A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M(I)M′(III)X&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, has shown great potential in improving their emission properties. While the site preference of monovalent or trivalent metal dopants is on the expected lines, the same is not true for bivalent dopants, like Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, etc. In this Letter, we employ positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy measurements along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to address the preferred doping site of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgInCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskite structure.

Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a negative thermal quenching of the Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; emission, attributed to effective energy transfer from self-trapped excitons to Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, explained using a two-term Arrhenius equation.

Compared to the widely studied nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers exhibit more than a tenfold increase in coherent photon emission. In this work, we investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressure and tension on the SiV center in diamond using first-principles calculations with the r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;SCAN meta-GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation) functional. We demonstrate that under hydrostatic tension corresponding to an isotropic expansion exceeding 4%, the SiV center undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking from the inversion-symmetric &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; structure to the asymmetric &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, similar to that of the NV center. Within the hydrostatic compression and tension range corresponding to isotropic deformations of −8%–4%, the optical properties and hyperfine parameters of the SiV center change monotonically, indicating promising potential for pressure- or deformation-sensing applications. A microscopic explanation of these trends is provided from an electronic structure perspective. The r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;SCAN meta-GGA functional shows high accuracy in calculating hyperfine parameters, in agreement with experimental results. This study enhances our understanding of the optical properties and hyperfine interactions of SiV defects in diamond, laying the groundwork for their potential use in hydrostatic pressure or strain

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Defects from Quantum Reset Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00230</link><description>arXiv:2602.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze mechanisms for universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics near criticality by exploring the effect of randomized quantum resetting (QR) under a finite-time quench across a quantum phase transition. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $\tau$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $\tau$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discrete holography and density of states in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00231</link><description>arXiv:2602.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tight-binding models in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices, realized through the successive insertion of Euclidean defects into hyperbolic lattices. We analyze how the holographic two-point boundary correlation function and bulk density of states evolve as defects are gradually introduced. We find that bulk properties are strongly affected by the presence of Euclidean defects, whereas boundary observables remain remarkably robust even at high defect fractions. This robustness indicates that essential features of boundary physics on hyperbolic lattices, which capture aspects of AdS/CFT-like dualities in discrete systems, can be reproduced both experimentally and numerically without requiring perfectly hyperbolic lattices, thereby reducing the system size needed for implementation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A seven-facet polyhedron captures the composition-only formation-energy landscape of inorganic solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00254</link><description>arXiv:2602.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that the convex hull of formation energies for solid compounds involving elements from hydrogen to uranium admits a remarkably simple description over the 92-dimensional space of chemical compositions, despite the enormous combinatorial complexity of possible atomic structures. By training an interpretable max-affine model directly on near-hull formation energies from the Materials Project density-functional theory (DFT) database, we find that the hull can be reconstructed to DFT accuracy using a polyhedron with only seven facets. These facets define seven chemically coherent materials classes, with just seven coefficients per element sufficing to capture the dominant energetic trends across composition space. Remarkably, this compact, composition-only representation generalizes far beyond bulk formation energies. Without retraining or structural input, the same model reproduces trends in DFT-calculated defect formation energies, captures experimentally observed elemental mixing correlations in high-entropy materials, and enables the construction and optimization of Pourbaix diagrams for electrochemical stability. Together, these results show that many materials properties governed by energy differences can be expressed as simple linear combinations of a small set of interpretable, element-specific parameters. The result is a bonding-geometry-free thermodynamic framework that unifies stability, defects, mixing, and electrochemistry, and enables rapid, interpretable screening across vast chemical spaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00254v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defects, Corrugation and Temperature Govern Rarefied-Air Drag on Graphene Coatings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00285</link><description>arXiv:2602.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rarefied atmospheric environments, where continuum fluid dynamics breaks down, aerodynamic drag is governed by gas-surface momentum exchange, making surface structure and chemistry key design knobs. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that coating the $\alpha$-Al2O3(0001) surface with graphene markedly reduces the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) of N2, shifting scattering toward more specular reflection and thereby lowering drag; we further benchmark this response against graphite. The reduction strengthens up to 900 K. While structural defects can increase TMAC via defect-induced corrugation and local atomic and electronic rearrangements, graphene retains its performance at experimentally relevant defect densities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the Landauer formula in interfacial thermal transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00323</link><description>arXiv:2602.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this commentary, we clarify that the Landauer formula is not limited to the phonon gas model. It is fundamentally more general and applies to both particle- and wave-based descriptions of phonons, provided the transmission function is well defined. In the harmonic regime, the phonon transmission function and the resulting Landauer expression for heat current are exact. They can be rigorously derived using the atomistic Green's function method, which treats phonons as waves and does not require phonon dispersion in the interface region. In short, the Landauer framework remains valid for ideal, disordered, and defective interfaces, as long as an appropriate transmission function is used.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interatomic potentials for platinum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00379</link><description>arXiv:2602.00379v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Elastic, Quasielastic, and Superelastic Electron Scattering from Thermal Lattice Distortions in Perfect Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00796</link><description>arXiv:2602.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional treatments of electron transport, momentum relaxation within a perfect, defect free crystal is commonly assumed to require phonon creation or annihilation. Here we treat the crystal as finite and isolated, retaining the lattice center of mass (recoil) degree of freedom and enforcing conservation of total mechanical momentum alongside discrete crystal pseudomomentum. Starting from the density density form of the electron lattice interaction, we find that an electron in the interior of a perfect crystal admits strong, and in some regimes dominant, elastic momentum relaxing scattering channels, in which momentum is conserved by recoil of the lattice background without phonon excitation. In addition, we identify mixed quasielastic and superelastic channels in which phonon occupations change but do not account fully for the electron's momentum transfer. These results provide a microscopic basis for momentum relaxation that does not rely on local energy dissipation. They naturally reconcile a wide range of experimental observations, including weak localization, quantum oscillations, ultrasonic attenuation, and the separation of momentum and energy relaxation times, with predominantly elastic scattering in clean crystals. The framework clarifies how diffusive transport, including Planckian scale diffusion, can emerge from elastic dynamics in a time dependent lattice background.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric quantum critical point in superconducting hydrides: The case of H$_3$S</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00833</link><description>arXiv:2602.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$_3$S sulfur hydride has been widely investigated for its high superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 203 K at about $p_c = 155$ GPa. Despite being the precursor of superconducting hydrides, a detailed picture of its phase diagram in an extended temperature and pressure range is still missing. To determine it with inclusion of both thermal and quantum effects, we carry out path integral molecular dynamics combined to a MACE neural network potential trained on BLYP density functional theory configurations. The resulting H$_3$S phase diagram is characterized by the ferroelectric transition between the Im$\bar{3}$m and R3m phases, which originates from a quantum critical point (QCP) located at $p_\mathrm{QCP} \approx 134$ GPa. We show that the experimental $T_c$ peak falls into a paraelectric region of large nuclear quantum fluctuations above the ferroelectric QCP, as measured by local phonon Green's functions resolved in imaginary time, where fluctuating dipole moments are at play. We study the critical behavior of the system in the proximity of the QCP by a finite-size scaling analysis, showing that it belongs to the 4D Ising universality class. We finally discuss its implications for the superconducting state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00833v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards knowledge-based workflows: a semantic approach to atomistic simulations for mechanical and thermodynamic properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01358</link><description>arXiv:2602.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical and thermodynamic properties, including the influence of crystal defects, are critical for evaluating materials in engineering applications. Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insight into these mechanisms at the atomic scale. However, current practice often relies on fragmented scripts with inconsistent metadata and limited provenance, which hinders reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse. FAIR data principles and workflow-based approaches offer a path to address these limitations. We present reusable atomistic workflows that incorporate metadata annotation aligned with application ontologies, enabling automatic provenance capture and FAIR-compliant data outputs. The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework. The approach provides AI-ready simulation data, supports emerging agentic AI workflows, and establishes a generalizable blueprint for knowledge-based mechanical and thermodynamic simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin Relaxometry with Solid-State Defects: Theory, Platforms, and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01521</link><description>arXiv:2602.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin relaxometry using solid-state spin defects, such as the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, probes dynamical processes by measuring how environmental fluctuations enhance the spin relaxation rate. In the weak-coupling limit, relaxation rates sample the transverse magnetic-noise power spectral density through a sensor-specific filter function, turning the defect into a local, frequency-selective noise spectrometer. This review bridges theory and experiment, clarifying how measured relaxation rates map onto noise spectra and how near-field geometry shapes the response. We highlight representative applications across condensed-matter physics, chemical and biological sensing, and relaxometry-based magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. We conclude with emerging opportunities and key challenges.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferromagnetic Ferroelectricity due to Orbital Ordering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01680</link><description>arXiv:2602.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realization of ferromagnetic ferroelectricity, combining two ferroic orders in a single phase, is the longstanding problem of great practical importance. One of the difficulties is that ferromagnetism alone cannot break inversion symmetry $\mathcal{I}$. Therefore, such a phase cannon be obtained by purely magnetic means. Here, we show how it can be designed by making orbital degrees of freedom active. The idea can be traced back to a basic principle of interatomic exchange, which states that an alternation of occupied orbitals along a bond (i.e., antiferro orbital order) favors ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the antiferro orbital order breaks $\mathcal{I}$, so that the bond becomes not simply ferromagnetic but also ferroelectric. Then, we formulate main principles governing the realization of such a state in solids, namely: (i) The magnetic atoms should not be located in inversion centers, as in the honeycomb lattice; (ii) The orbitals should be flexible enough to adjust they shape and minimize the energy of exchange interactions; (iii) This flexibility can be achieved by intraatomic interactions, which are responsible for Hund's second rule and compete with the crystal field splitting; (iv) For octahedrally coordinated transition-metal compounds, the most promising candidates appear to be iodides with a $d^{2}$ configuration and relatively weak $d$-$p$ hybridization. Such a situation is realized in the van der Walls compound VI$_3$, which we expect to be ferromagnetic ferroelectric.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Degenerate Soft Modes and Selective Condensation in BaAl$_2$O$_4$ via Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01732</link><description>arXiv:2602.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaAl$_2$O$_4$ is a ferroelectric material that exhibits structural quantum criticality through chemical composition tuning. Although theoretical calculations and several diffraction experiments have suggested the involvement of a soft mode in its ferroelectric structural phase transition, direct experimental verification is still lacking. In this study, we successfully observed two soft modes of BaAl$_2$O$_4$ using x-ray inelastic scattering, providing direct experimental evidence for their role in the structural phase transition. Furthermore, we reveal that the soft modes at the M and K points are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating a delicate balance in which either mode could potentially freeze. The K-point mode simultaneously softens toward the transition temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) in a manner nearly identical to the M-point mode. However, the phase transition condenses only at the M point, with the M-point mode stabilizing as an acoustic mode in the low-temperature structure and the K-point mode hardening as temperature decreases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01732v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fe-DCA Metal-Organic Frameworks on the Bi2Se3(0001) Topological Insulator Surface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01940</link><description>arXiv:2602.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an inert surface of a topological insulator (TI) is a pathway to engineer quantum materials with exotic properties. MOFs featuring ferromagnetically coupled metal atoms are theoretically predicted to induce an exchange gap in the TI surface band structure, potentially leading to a quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, achieving ordered MOFs on TI surfaces remains challenging due to the limited knowledge of self-assembly on these substrates. In this paper, we demonstrate self-assembly of Fe atoms and dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules into 2D MOFs on the Bi2Se3(0001) surface at room temperature, investigated via a combination of low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction (LEEM/LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Two competing Fe-DCA phases form. The first phase corresponds to a close-packed Fe1DCA3 structure. In contrast, the second phase exhibits a larger unit cell with no match to either known or DFT-calculated systems, indicating a more complex bonding environment. These findings advance the understanding of the growth of MOFs on a strong topological insulator surface and provide insights for designing MOFs/TI interfaces with tailored electronic and magnetic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optical properties of Fermi polarons in a GaInP/MoSe2 monolayer heterostructure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01964</link><description>arXiv:2602.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering optical properties, such as luminescence purity and charge transfer, is crucial for harnessing the application potential of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). While electrostatic gating is widely applied to gain charge control in TMDC monolayers, charge transfer can also be engineered via coupling of TMDC monolayers at semiconductor III/V, organic, or van der Waals interfaces. This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence. Through optical absorption measurements, we verify that the charged complexes acquire substantial oscillator strength. Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, supported by a microscopic theory framework, evidences the suppression of the characteristic carrier recoil effect that was previously observed in the photoluminescence of trions in TMDCs. These phenomena allow us to identify the optical signatures at the TMDC-GaInP interface as Fermi polaron quasiparticle resonances, which are of high importance in researching Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01964v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine-Learned Hamiltonians for Quantum Transport Simulation of Valence Change Memories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02125</link><description>arXiv:2602.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of the Hamiltonian matrix \textbf{H} is an essential, yet computationally expensive step in \textit{ab-initio} device simulations based on density-functional theory (DFT). In homogeneous structures, the fact that a unit cell repeats itself along at least one direction can be leveraged to minimize the number of atoms considered and the calculation time. However, such an approach does not lend itself to amorphous or defective materials for which no periodicity exists. In these cases, (much) larger domains containing thousands of atoms might be needed to accurately describe the physics at play, pushing DFT tools to their limit. Here we address this issue by learning and directly predicting the Hamiltonian matrix of large structures through equivariant graph neural networks and so-called augmented partitioning training. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by modeling valence change memory (VCM) cells, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.39 to 3.58 meV, as compared to DFT, when predicting the Hamiltonian matrix entries of systems made of $\sim$5,000 atoms. We then replace the DFT-computed Hamiltonian of these VCMs with the predicted one to compute their energy-resolved transmission function with a quantum transport tool. A qualitatively good agreement between both sets of curves is obtained.

Abstract: Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-restricted energy landscapes as a benchmark for machine learned interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02237</link><description>arXiv:2602.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02237v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Energy-Transfer-Enhanced Emission and Quantum Sensing of VB- Defects in hBN-PbI2 Heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02256</link><description>arXiv:2602.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanics of incompatible asymmetric grain boundary migration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02387</link><description>arXiv:2602.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even "ratcheting" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spectroscopic Signatures of a Liouvillian Exceptional Spectral Phase in a Collective Spin</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01375</link><description>arXiv:2602.01375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian degeneracies of Lindblad generators (Liouvillian exceptional points) can induce non-exponential relaxation and higher-order poles in dynamical response functions. A collective spin coupled to a polarized Markovian bath exhibits an \emph{exceptional spectral phase} in which defective Liouvillian modes imprint super-Lorentzian features in frequency-resolved spectra. We compute the emission spectrum via the Liouvillian resolvent, identify symmetry-sector selection rules, and demonstrate that exceptional-point signatures are strongly state-dependent: they are suppressed in steady-state fluorescence yet become unambiguous for generic (infinite-temperature or random) initial states. Our results provide an experimentally accessible spectroscopic diagnostic of many-body Liouvillian exceptional phases and clarify when steady-state emission can (and cannot) reveal them.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01375v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] General teleparallel geometric theory of defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01408</link><description>arXiv:2602.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the geometric theory of defects. In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01408v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Diffuse-Interface Method for Pore Dynamics in Lipid Membranes under Electric Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03902</link><description>arXiv:1611.03902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1611.03902v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Aspect-ratio-dependent void formation in active rhomboidal and elliptical particle systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00308</link><description>arXiv:2302.00308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2302.00308v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active Screws: Emergent Active Chiral Nematics of Spinning Self-Propelled Rods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12263</link><description>arXiv:2410.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, they form an active nematic at high density and activity. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.12263v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A continuous symmetry breaking measure for finite clusters using Jensen-Shannon divergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21880</link><description>arXiv:2410.21880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantitative measure of symmetry breaking is introduced that allows the quantification of which symmetries are most strongly broken due to the introduction of some kind of defect in a perfect structure. The method uses a statistical approach based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The measure is calculated by comparing the transformed atomic density function with its original. Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.21880v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transition between 2D Symmetry Protected Topological Phases on a Klein Bottle</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00587</link><description>arXiv:2510.00587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manifolds with nontrivial topology play an essential role in the study of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we study the nontrivial symmetry response of the $2+1$D $Z_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase when the system is put on a non-orientable manifold -- the Klein bottle. In particular, we find that when a symmetry defect is inserted along the orientation-reversing cycle of the Klein bottle, the ground state of the system gets an extra charge. This response remains well defined at transition points into the trivial SPT phase, resulting in an exact two-fold degeneracy in the ground state independent of the system size. We demonstrate the symmetry response using exactly solvable lattice models of the SPT phase, as well as numerical work across the transition. We explore the connection of this result to the modular transformation of the $3+1$D $Z_2$ gauge theory and the emergent nature of the parity symmetry in the $Z_2$ SPT phase.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00587v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01419</link><description>arXiv:2510.01419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01419v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergent Hierarchy in Localized States of Organic Quantum Chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02231</link><description>arXiv:2510.02231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02231v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emulating 2D Materials with Magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03210</link><description>arXiv:2601.03210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03210v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13283</link><description>arXiv:2601.13283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13283v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link><description>arXiv:2509.19877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19877v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222</link><description>arXiv:2511.05222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05222v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bose polarons as relativistic Unruh-DeWitt detectors: Entanglement harvesting from Bose-Einstein condensates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21381</link><description>arXiv:2512.21381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: Hydrogen uptake in brownmillerite perovskites A2B2O5 offers an (electro)chemically accessible route to tune functional properties, but mechanistic understanding and design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides remain limited. Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation. Together, these results establish practical design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides relevant to iono-electronic devices, sensors, and electrically tunable spin functionality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Single-Shot Flow Spectroscopy of a Polariton Condensate: Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov-Like Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22719</link><description>arXiv:2601.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized vortices are fundamental topological excitations of quantum fluids. We report single-shot interferometric measurements of spontaneous vortex nucleation in a room-temperature organic exciton-polariton condensate. From hundreds of independent realizations we find random vortex-core positions and unbiased circulation, consistent with intrinsically stochastic, unpinned defect formation. The mean vortex number scales with pump power above threshold with an exponent consistent with Kibble-Zurek freeze-out in a driven-dissipative condensate. Using reconstructed phase maps we obtain single-shot flow fields, compute the incompressible component, and extract kinetic-energy spectra. Vortex-containing realizations develop a robust Kolmogorov-like segment with Einc(k) proportional to k^(-5/3) over a finite k range, indicating the onset of turbulent spectral scaling in a quantum fluid of light. These results establish single-shot access to phase and flow as a direct route to quantifying stochastic defect formation and emerging turbulence in polariton condensates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22719v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric switching at edge dislocations in BaTiO$_3$ modelled at the atomic scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22827</link><description>arXiv:2601.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric switching governs the functional properties of ferroelectric perovskites. It is widely accepted that this switching depends on domain nucleation and pinning and that these processes can be controlled by the defect structure. However, an atomistic picture of the influence of one important class of defects - dislocations on ferroelectric switching is missing. This is an important gap in knowledge as dislocations cannot be avoided at interfaces and can also be engineered by plastic deformation at high temperatures. Using atomistic simulations, we show how the cores of $\langle100\rangle$ edge dislocations in BaTiO$_3$ can either act as nucleation centers for ferroelectric switching or pin walls depending on the direction of the applied field. The coupling between electric field and polarization is strongest when the field is applied parallel to the Burgers vector of the dislocation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Gate-tuneable single-photon emitters in WSe2 monolayer created via AFM nanoindentation on rigid SiO2/Si substrates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22869</link><description>arXiv:2601.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials are envisioned for next-generation quantum applications. However, SPE creation in 2D semiconductors on rigid substrates like SiO2/Si via nanoindentation is a technological gap, critical for interfacing SPEs with photonic circuits and cavities. Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths &gt; 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 {\mu}eV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs. Our work is directly applicable to other 2D materials and photonic circuit/cavity compatible rigid substrates and is a significant step for scalable SPE technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unlocking the Power of Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory to Explore the Electronic Structure Under Extreme Conditions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23002</link><description>arXiv:2601.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in X-ray free-electron laser diagnostics have enabled direct probing of the electronic structure under extreme pressures and temperatures, such as those encountered in stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion experiments, challenging theoretical models for interpreting experimental data. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] In-situ Straining of Epitaxial Freestanding Ferroic Films through a MEMS Device</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23218</link><description>arXiv:2601.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical strain can be used to control physical properties in materials. The experimental investigation of strain-induced effects at the nanoscale is of importance not only for its fundamental aspect, but also for the development of device applications. Transmission X-ray microscopy is a particularly well-suited technique for the nanoscale imaging of magnetic materials, but its compatibility with in-situ mechanical straining of samples is limited. In this work, we present a setup for applying tailored in-situ mechanical strains to freestanding thin films by means of a micro electromechanical system (MEMS) actuator. We then present a proof-of-concept experiment where a freestanding 80 nm thick (001) BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic thin film is strained with the MEMS device, allowing us to control the coupled ferroelectric/spin cycloidal configuration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23218v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical density functional theory for dense odd-diffusive fluids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23284</link><description>arXiv:2601.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd diffusion breaks time-reversal symmetry in overdamped systems through transverse probability currents while preserving equilibrium steady states. In this work, we develop a dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) for dense interacting odd-diffusive fluids and apply it to ultrasoft particles in two dimensions. In bulk, odd diffusion qualitatively reshapes collective relaxation by generating transient circulating current patterns which do not exist in normal fluids. Under harmonic ring confinement, the circulation of probability current induces an angular redistribution of density along the ring during relaxation. This unique footprint of odd diffusion opens up a shorter pathway to equilibrium. Repulsive interactions significantly enhance these effects. Excellent agreement with Brownian dynamics simulations confirms that our odd-DDFT framework quantitatively captures all essential nonequilibrium aspects of the nontrivial odd transport and collective redistribution for dense fluids in both bulk and confined geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link><description>arXiv:2601.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22312</link><description>arXiv:2601.22312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we develop an effective theory and propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. This sliding mechanism breaks the $\mathcal{M}_{z}\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.01759v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride as two-dimensional strain sensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18745</link><description>arXiv:2509.18745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice deformation is a powerful way to engineer the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, making their precise measurement an important challenge for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) enable quantitative strain sensing with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. Using this approach, we precisely quantify the strain-induced shift of the E$_{\rm 2g}$ Raman mode in a multilayer hBN flake under uniaxial stress, establishing V$_\text{B}^-$ centers as a new tool for strain metrology in van der Waals heterostructures. Beyond strain sensing, our work also highlights the unique multimodal sensing functionalities offered by V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which will be valuable for future studies of strain-engineered 2D materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.18745v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23236</link><description>arXiv:2510.23236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co -- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150 meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated skyrmions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23236v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-orbit coupled spin-boson model : A variational analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26468</link><description>arXiv:2510.26468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26468v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Consequences of symmetry-breaking on conformal defect data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26561</link><description>arXiv:2509.26561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal defects spontaneously break part of the symmetry algebra of a bulk CFT. We show that the broken Ward identities imply very general sum rules on the defect CFT data as well as on the DOE data of bulk operators, which we call defect soft theorems. Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones, including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact, optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26561v2</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small Methods: Table of Contents] High Power Density for All‐Fe2VAl‐based Thermoelectric Module by Enhancing the Power Factor of p‐type Leg Through Defect‐Engineering and Wetting Effect</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smtd.202502360?af=R</link><description>Small Methods, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small Methods: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:57:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smtd.202502360</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] FDA-approved PDE4 inhibitors alleviate the dominant toxicity of ALS-FTD-associated CHCHD10S59L in Drosophila and human cells.</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00254-3?rss=yes</link><description>Mutations in CHCHD10 are a genetic cause of ALS-FTD.

However, the impact of light-element occupancy on HAADF contrast is rarely explored, which impedes understanding of the material properties. Here, we observe an oxygen-vacancy (Vo) order induced periodic A-site intensity modulation in HAADF images of La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2.75&lt;/sub&gt; thin films.

In combination with integrated differential phase contrast microscopy, our multi-slice HAADF image simulations and extended studies on ABO&lt;sub&gt;2.75&lt;/sub&gt; (A = Sr, La; B = Ti, Co, Mn) reveal that the intensity modulation is attributed to (1) T-layer-based interlayer expansion, (2) polarity of the adjacent AO plane, and (3) oxygen octahedral rotation in Mn- and Co-containing oxides. While for Ti-containing ABO&lt;sub&gt;2.75&lt;/sub&gt; oxides, the intensity modulation is only governed by the former two factors.

Neuromorphic computing offers a brain-inspired approach that unifies computation and memory within a single hardware framework, enabling massively parallel, low-power information processing. Among various device candidates, memtransistors incorporate a gate terminal that enables independent modulation of resistive switching and channel conductance, thereby allowing the realization of complex learning functions and effectively suppressing sneak-path currents in array architectures. This perspective outlines the operation principles of memtransistors based on diverse physical mechanisms, including ion migration, charge trapping, ferroelectric switching, and phase transitions, and then discusses recent materials and architectural engineering strategies, with particular emphasis on two-dimensional channels and scalable array integration. Beyond device-level behavior, bio-inspired functionalities, such as heterosynaptic and homeostatic plasticity, are highlighted as key ingredients for stable and self-regulated learning in neural networks. The integration of memtransistors with sensory modules is further examined to enable near-sensor and in-sensor computing, paving the way for multimodal signal processing that parallels biological perception. Finally, critical challenges and opportunities in variability control, CMOS-compatible processing, and three-dimensional, multisensory integration are identified, indicating that continued progress in material design and architecture optimization will be essential for positioning memtransistors as key enablers of autonomous, bio-inspired intelligence in future robotics, healthcare, and cognitive electronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/2/020901/3378038/Memtransistor-for-bio-inspired-neuromorphic</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today] Harnessing ferroelectric domain wall optoelectronics for bitstream data security</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702126000611?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: March–April 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Materials Today, Volume 93&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Changdong Liu, Wenzhao Wang, Tiancong Cao, Mohammad A.

Abstract: Recent works have suggested that transient suppression of a charge density wave (CDW) by an ultra-short excitation can lead to an inversion of the CDW phase. We experimentally investigate the dynamics of the CDW in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ by time resolved x-ray diffraction after excitation with optical pulses. Our results indicate a transient inversion of the CDW phase close to the surface that evolves into a highly disordered state in less than one picosecond. Numerical simulations solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation including disorder from strong pinning defects reproduce our main observations. Our findings highlight the critical role of disorder in schemes for coherent control in condensed matter systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21030v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field-Induced Ferroelectric Phase Transition Dynamics in PMN-PT compositions near the Morphotropic Phase Boundary</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21055</link><description>arXiv:2601.21055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical behavior of field-induced ferroelectric phase transitions in compositions of PbMg_{1/3}Nb_{2/3}O3(1-x)-PbTiO3(x), called PMN-PT, near the Morphotropic Phase Boundary (MPB) was investigated through several different external electrical field application protocols. Our results indicate that the phase transitions in PMN-PT compositions near the MPB behave differently than in compositions far below the MPB. We show that the electrical-field history has a notable impact on the field-induced transition temperature T_c, ZFC delay time tau_{ZFC}, and induced polarization P_c, gained/lost during field-induced phase transition. Moreover, we demonstrate that under certain field-temperature conditions PMN-PT can retain its electrical field history and use it to kinetically accelerate its ferroelectric ordering. An explanation for the key difference between the phase transition dynamics in compositions near and far from the MPB is proposed and contextualized within prior publications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21055v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accelerated Inorganic Electrides Discovery by Generative Models and Hierarchical Screening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21077</link><description>arXiv:2601.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrides are exotic compounds in which excess electrons occupy interstitial regions of the crystal lattice and serve as anions, exhibiting exceptional properties such as low work function, high electron mobility, and strong catalytic activity. Although they show promise for diverse applications, identifying new electrides remains challenging due to the difficulty of achieving energetically favorable electron localization in crystal cavities. Here, we present an accelerated materials discovery framework that combines physical principles, diffusion-based materials generation with hierarchical thermodynamic and electronic structure screening. Using this workflow, we systematically explored 1,510 binary and 6,654 ternary chemical compositions containing excess valence electrons from electropositive alkaline, alkaline-earth, and early transition metals, and then filtered them with a high throughput validation on both thermodynamical stability and electronic structure analysis. As a result, we have identified 264 new electron rich compounds within 0.05 eV/atom above the convex hull at the density functional theory (DFT) level, including 13 thermodynamically stable electrides. Our approach demonstrates a generalizable strategy for targeted materials discovery in a vast chemical space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The First Switch Effect in Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21107</link><description>arXiv:2601.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FEFET) is systematically characterized and compared with an equivalent standard MOSFET with an equivalent oxide thickness. We show that these two devices, with a silicon channel, exhibit similar pristine state transfer characteristics but starkly different endurance characteristics. In contrast to the MOSFET, the FEFET shows a significant increase in sub-threshold swing in the first write pulse. Based on this, we reveal that this first write pulse (cycle 1) generates more than half of the total traps generated during the fatigue cycling in FEFETs. We call this the 'First Switch Effect'. Further, by polarizing a pristine FEFET step by step, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the switched polarization and interface trap density during the first switch. Through charge pumping measurements, we also observe that continued cycling generates traps more towards the bulk of the stack, away from the Si/SiO2 interface in FEFETs. We establish that: (1) the first switch effect leads to approximately 50% of the total trap density (Nit) near the Si/SiO2 interface until memory window closure; and (2) further bipolar cycling leads to trap generation both at and away from Si/SiO2 interface in FEFETs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21107v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunneling probe-based identification of the sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the H-C(100):$2\times1$ surface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21154</link><description>arXiv:2601.21154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the diamond surface plays a critical role in the performance and fabrication of diamond quantum technologies. For the former, the magnetic and electric properties of this defect can impede the performance of quantum sensors and computers. For the latter, the chemical properties of the dangling bond are integral to proposed methods for bottom-up fabrication of scalable diamond quantum devices. In pursuit of high performance and scalable diamond quantum technology, tunneling probe-based techniques offers the ability to create and modify the sp${}^3$ dangling bond with atomic-scale precision. However, these capabilities cannot be realised either deterministically or at scale without a means for identifying the sp${}^3$ dangling bond amidst the myriad of other defects on the diamond surface. Consequently, in this work we provide a comprehensive experimental and theoretical framework for STS-based characterisation of the sp${}^3$ defect on the H-terminated (100) diamond surface. This capability provides the foundation for future tunneling probe studies in the modification of dangling bonds.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] One-Dimensional Electronic States in a Moir\'e Superlattice of Twisted Bilayer WTe2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21228</link><description>arXiv:2601.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) moir\'e superlattices provide a new route to engineering reduced-dimensional electronic states in van der Waals materials, yet their electronic structure and microscopic origin remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a 1D moir\'e superlattice formed in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ using density functional theory calculations, complemented by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We show that lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moir\'e stripes, leading to stacking-dependent stripe widths that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The relaxed structure hosts quasi-one-dimensional electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction and nearly flat dispersion in the perpendicular direction. By comparing the full bilayer with isolated relaxed layers, we establish that these 1D electronic states are governed predominantly by an intralayer moir\'e potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than by interlayer hybridization. We extract this position-dependent moir\'e potential directly from DFT calculations and construct an effective tight-binding model that reproduces both the band dispersion and the real-space localization of the electronic wave functions. Our results identify lattice relaxation as the key mechanism underlying 1D electronic states in 1D moir\'e superlattices. %and establish twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring emergent one-dimensional moir\'e physics. The framework developed here provides a unified theoretical basis for realizing and exploring one-dimensional moir\'e physics in a broad class of anisotropic two-dimensional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21273</link><description>arXiv:2601.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The roles of bulk and surface thermodynamics in the selective adsorption of a confined azeotropic mixture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21591</link><description>arXiv:2601.21591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid mixtures that exhibit an azeotrope cannot be purified by simple bulk distillation. Consequently, there is strong motivation to understand the behavior of azeotropic mixtures under confinement. We address this problem using a machine-learning-enhanced classical density functional theory applied to a binary Lennard-Jones mixture that exhibits azeotropic phase behavior. As proof-of-principle of a "train once, learn many" strategy, our approach combines a neural functional trained on a single-component repulsive reference system with a mean-field treatment of attractive interactions, derived within the framework of hyperdensity functional theory (hyper-DFT). The theory faithfully describes capillary condensation and results from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, by taking advantage of a known accurate equation of state, the theory we present well-describes bulk thermodynamics by construction. Exploiting the computational efficiency of hyper-DFT, we systematically evaluate adsorption selectivity across a wide range of compositions, pressures, temperatures, and wall-fluid affinities. In cases where the wall-fluid interaction is the same for both species, we find that the pore becomes completely unselective at the bulk azeotropic composition. Strikingly, this unselective point persists far from liquid-vapor coexistence, including in the supercritical regime. Analysis of the bulk equation of state across a wide range of thermodynamic state points shows that the azeotropic composition coincides with equal partial molar volumes and an extremum in the isothermal compressibility. A complementary thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that unselective adsorption corresponds to an aneotrope (a point of zero relative adsorption) and an extremum in the interfacial free energy. We also find that the two interfaces of the slit pore behave independently down to remarkably small slits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-invertible translation from Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21625</link><description>arXiv:2601.21625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21625v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Watching Polarons Form in Real Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21810</link><description>arXiv:2601.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaron formation in pump-probe experiments is an inherently non-equilibrium phenomenon, driven by the ultrafast coupled dynamics of electrons and phonons, and culminating in the emergence of a localized quasiparticle state. In this work, we present a first-principles quantum-kinetic theory of polaron formation that captures the real-time evolution of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in presence of electron-phonon coupling. We implement this framework to investigate the ultrafast polaron formation in the prototypical polar insulator MgO. This approach allows us to determine the characteristic timescales of polaron localization and to identify its distinctive dynamical fingerprint. Our results establish clear and experimentally accessible criteria for identifying polaron formation in pump-probe experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21056</link><description>arXiv:2601.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.
  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Polaron-Polaritons in Subwavelength Arrays of Trapped Atoms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21062</link><description>arXiv:2601.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezers are inherently susceptible to deformations: Optomechanical forces produce lattice distortions, which, in turn, modify the optical response of the array. We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Thermophysical Properties of Water using Machine-Learned Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21103</link><description>arXiv:2601.21103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect Relative Entropy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21875</link><description>arXiv:2601.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{defect relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of defects. We compute the defect relative entropy for conformal/topological defects, deriving a universal formula in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. This formula reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21875v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular structure, binding, and disorder in TDBC-Ag plexcitonic assemblies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22022</link><description>arXiv:2601.22022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plexcitonic assemblies are hybrid materials composed of a plasmonic nanoparticle and molecular or semiconducting emitters whose electronic transitions are strongly coupled to the plasmonic mode. This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Designing quantum technologies with a quantum computer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22091</link><description>arXiv:2601.22091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting spin systems in solids underpin a wide range of quantum technologies, from quantum sensors and single-photon sources to spin-defect-based quantum registers and processors. We develop a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions, dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit technologies under experimentally realistic conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09519</link><description>arXiv:2307.09519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2307.09519v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of dislocation bound states and skin effects in non-Hermitian Chern insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02824</link><description>arXiv:2504.02824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The confluence of non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding an edge dislocations-antidislocation pair in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. We experimentally identify the emergence of bulk exceptional points (EPs) via spectral coalescence and phase rigidity analysis. We demonstrate that the NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states driven by these EPs under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings, therefore, pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.02824v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Novel Transformations of PbTiO3 with Pressure and Temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05756</link><description>arXiv:2511.05756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the behavior of lead titanate (PbTiO3) up to 100 GPa, both at room temperature and upon laser heating, using synchrotron X ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations. At the high pressure temperature (PT) conditions produced in laser heated diamond anvil cells, PbTiO3 dissociates into PbO and TiO2, consistent with our DFT computations showing that decomposition becomes enthalpically favored above 65 GPa. In contrast, on room temperature compression, PbTiO3 persists in the tetragonal I4mcm phase up to at least 100 GPa. Laser heating produces distinct PbO phases: a compressed form of alpha PbO and a previously unreported delta PbO polymorph, both of which transform to beta PbO on decompression. The calculations predict that alpha PbO undergoes pressure-induced band gap closure, metallizing above 70 GPa, whereas the delta and beta phases remain semiconducting with a band gap above 1 eV even at megabar pressures. The experimental and confirming theoretical results reveal an unanticipated dimension of the behavior of PbTiO3, showing that distinct equilibrium and metastable phases can be stabilized along different PT synthesis paths.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05756v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CO on a Rh/Fe3O4 single-atom catalyst: high-resolution infrared spectroscopy and near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15194</link><description>arXiv:2512.15194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms, monocarbonyls at fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms embedded in the surface, and gem-dicarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, RhCO monocarbonyl species at adatom sites dominate. Rh(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh dimers rather than sequential adsorption of two CO molecules at an isolated, twofold Rh adatom. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15194v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v3</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis] BEA zeolite encapsulated defective Co sites for solvent- and additive-free N-alkylation of amines with aromatic alcohols</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726000473?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: March 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Catalysis, Volume 455&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Meng Xu, Zhongliang Tang, Yue Wu, Menglin Xie, Biao Meng, Xiao Chi, Xiaojiang Yu, Xiaoling Liu, Shibo Xi, Yu Zhou, Jun Wang&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 01:46:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726000473</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Growth of rhombohedral-stacked single-crystal WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vertical heterostructures</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68935-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 30 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68935-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68935-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rhombohedral-stacked structures formed by 2D semiconductors are characterized by emerging physical properties, but their bottom-up growth remains challenging.

Abstract: We introduce ELECTRAFI, a fast, end-to-end differentiable model for predicting periodic charge densities in crystalline materials. ELECTRAFI constructs anisotropic Gaussians in real space and exploits their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients via the Poisson summation formula. This formulation delegates non-local and periodic behavior to analytic transforms, enabling reconstruction of the full periodic charge density with a single inverse FFT. By avoiding explicit real-space grid probing, periodic image summation, and spherical harmonic expansions, ELECTRAFI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across periodic benchmarks while being up to $633 \times$ faster than the strongest competing method, reconstructing crystal charge densities in a fraction of a second. When used to initialize DFT calculations, ELECTRAFI reduces total DFT compute cost by up to ~20%, whereas slower charge density models negate savings due to high inference times. Our results show that accuracy and inference cost jointly determine end-to-end DFT speedups, and motivate our focus on efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vibrational and Electronic Properties of Np2O5 from Experimental Spectroscopy and First Principles Calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20242</link><description>arXiv:2601.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-valence actinide oxides are critical to understanding the behavior of 5f-electrons, yet their structural and electronic properties remain poorly understood due to challenges in synthesis and handling. We report the first Raman spectroscopic study of single-crystalline Np2O5 and the first scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurement on any neptunium-containing material. Hydrothermally synthesized crystals were structurally verified by X-ray diffraction. Raman spectra revealed sharply resolved vibrational features, including previously unreported low-frequency modes. STS measurements revealed a band gap of 1.5 eV. Density functional theory (DFT) enables vibrational mode assignments, reveals neptunium-dominated low-frequency phonons, oxygen-dominated high-frequency modes, and predicts an indirect band gap of 1.68 eV. This predicted value is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured STS gap. This combined Raman, DFT, and STS approach provides a robust framework for correlating lattice dynamics and electronic structure in actinide materials, providing benchmark data for Np2O5, and opening new avenues for probing structure-property relationships in complex f-electron materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] ALD-Derived WO3-x Leads to Nearly Wake-Up-Free Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 at Elevated Temperatures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20271</link><description>arXiv:2601.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the memory wall in advanced computing architectures will require complex 3D integration of emerging memory materials such as ferroelectrics-either within the back-end-of-line (BEOL) of CMOS front-end processes or through advanced 3D packaging technologies. Achieving this integration demands that memory materials exhibit high thermal resilience, with the capability to operate reliably at elevated temperatures such as 125C, due to the substantial heat generated by front-end transistors. However, silicon-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectrics tend to exhibit antiferroelectric-like behavior in this temperature range, accompanied by a more pronounced wake-up effect, posing significant challenges to their thermal reliability. Here, we report that by introducing a thin tungsten oxide (WO3-x) layer-known as an oxygen reservoir-and carefully tuning its oxygen content, ultra-thin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (5 nm) films can be made robust against the ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition at elevated temperatures. This approach not only minimizes polarization loss in the pristine state but also effectively suppresses the wake-up effect, reducing the required wake-up cycles from 105 to only 10 at 125C- a qualifying temperature for back-end memory integrated with front-end logic, as defined by the JEDEC standard. First-principles density functional theory calculations reveal that WO3 enhances the stability of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase at elevated temperatures by increasing the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase energy gap, and promoting favorable phonon mode evolution, thereby supporting o-phase formation under both thermodynamic and kinetic constraints.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Contrasting impurity-induced magnetism and dynamics in 2H-MoTe2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20444</link><description>arXiv:2601.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of interstitial $^8$Li$^+$ implanted near the surface of 2H-MoTe$_2$ using $\beta$-detected NMR. We find that, unlike the muon, $^8$Li$^+$ does not show any signature of induced magnetism. This result is consistent with density functional theory, which identifies the Li stopping site at the 2a Wyckoff position in the van der Waals gap and confirms the absence of detectable Li-induced electronic spin polarization. Both the spin-lattice relaxation and the resonance lines show evidence of strong spin dynamics above $\sim 200$ K, reminiscent of local stochastic $^8$Li$^+$ motion within a cage. The resonance line shape consists of quadrupolar satellites on top of a broad central peak. To better understand the interaction of $^8$Li$^+$ with the host material, we employ a frequency-comb measurement, by simultaneously exciting four frequencies corresponding to the first-order quadrupolar satellite transitions, $\nu_0 \pm 3\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ and $\nu_0 \pm\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ around the Larmor frequency $\nu_0$ as a function of $\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$. This offers an enhanced sensitivity to the quadrupolar split portion of the line. Using this method, we find a small decrease of the quadrupolar frequency with increasing temperature, showing the typical behavior associated with thermally excited phonons and the absence of any magnetic response which was observed with other defects in 2H-MoTe$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological-transition-driven Giant Enhancement of Second-harmonic Generation in Ferroelectric Bismuth Monolayer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20454</link><description>arXiv:2601.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between band topology and light in condensed materials could unlock intriguing nonlinear optical phenomena, enabling modern photonic technologies such as quantum light sources and sub-wavelength topological lasers. Here, we unveil that a buckling-tuned topological transition in ferroelectric bismuth monolayer unleashes a giant second-harmonic generation. Using first-principles calculations, we surprisingly find that ferroelectric bismuth monolayer with a buckling parameter, $\Delta h$, has a large susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ on the order of $10^{7}$ $\mathrm{pm}^2/\mathrm{V}$, exceeding monolayer MoS$_2$ by about two orders of magnitude. When $\Delta h$ is engineered to the critical window where Dirac electrons emerge, a low-frequency resonance appears, boosting $\chi^{(2)}$ by an additional order of magnitude. We show that this enhancement is localized on the Dirac cones and dominated by intraband modification contributions. Based on an extended Dirac model, we establish that this enhancement physically originates from the ultralight effective masses $m^{*}$ of Dirac electrons through scaling with the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and band gap $E_g$. Our findings provide a general paradigm for achieving exceptional second-harmonic generation via engineering topological criticality, and could serve as an experimental signature of Dirac electrons in topological materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20454v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Epitaxial Ni/Cu Superlattice Nanowires with Atomically Sharp Interfaces for Spin Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20497</link><description>arXiv:2601.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of microstructure increases when decreasing the size of an object to the nanoscale, along with the complexity of controlling it. For instance, it is particularly complicated to create nano-object with controlled interfaces. Therefore, progressing towards 1D epitaxial nanostructures poses a challenge, and realization of their full potential is linked to technological issues of achieving large-scale, precise atom stacking of two or more different chemical elements. Achieving such coherent, epitaxial interfaces is a key step toward enabling spintronic phenomena in 1D objects, by minimizing interface scattering and strain-driven defects. Our results demonstrate a successful realization of controlled nanoscale heteroepitaxy in one-dimensional single-crystal structures. We fabricated nanowires composed of alternating magnetic (nickel) and non-magnetic, highly conductive (copper) segments. This periodic stacking modulates electron transport under magnetic stimuli. The epitaxial precision achieved eliminates detrimental electron scattering that has historically limited the magnetotransport properties of such 1D structures and hindered their development. Such materials are crucial for further advancements in the miniaturisation of nanosensors, actuators, and next-generation 3D spintronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20497v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Silicon Driven Facet Regulation Enables Tunable Micro-Diamond Architectures in Liquid Ga In</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20506</link><description>arXiv:2601.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an ambient pressure liquid metal assisted CVD strategy that enables shape programmable growth of micro scale diamond by coupling liquid metl Ga In with ferrocene (Fe(C5H5)2) as an carbon precursor, nanodiamond seeds, and nanosilicon. Building on liquid metal diamond synthesis, this approach pushes liquid metal growth toward a low temperature (900 {\deg}C, 1 atm) while enabling single crystal diamonds to be scaled from ~10 {\mu}m to several tens of micrometers with well developed faceting. Ferrocene decomposition supplies a sustained interfacial carbon flux that is captured and redistributed by the Ga In melt toward seed rich liquid solid interfaces. Defect rich nanodiamond provides the crystallographic template required for reliable sp3 nucleation despite the intrinsically low carbon solubility of Ga In. Nanosilicon plays a distinct, complementary role by tuning interfacial kinetics and facet competition, enabling deliberate control of crystal habit: cubic (~10 {\mu}m), truncated tetrahedral, and fully faceted octahedral diamonds are reproducibly obtained by adjusting the nanosilicon:nanodiamond ratio, with octahedral crystals reaching ~50 {\mu}m. Importantly, crystal size is further scaled by regulating hydrogen flow: lowering the H2 rate increases net carbon retention at the liquid metal interface, raises effective supersaturation, and accelerates diamond deposition. Together, habit control (via nanosilicon: nanodiamond) and size scaling (via H2 flow) establish a practical route silicon driven facet regulation and size under ambient pressure, offering a pathway to tunable micro sized single crystal diamonds under mild conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20506v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Polar Textures in Freestanding Ultrathin Ferroelectric Oxides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20534</link><description>arXiv:2601.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable advances achieved in two-dimensional materials are now being directly transposed to low-dimensional oxides.

Time-dependent electric fields enable reversible control, revealing freestanding oxide layers as ideal platforms to explore complex polar states and their potential applications in future ferroic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20534v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Impact of O concentration on the thermal stability and decomposition mechanism of (Cr,Al)N compared to (Ti,Al)N thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20691</link><description>arXiv:2601.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition-dependent thermal stability of (Cr$_{0.47 \mp 0.03}$Al$_{0.53 \mp 0.03}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$ thin films with O concentrations of y = 0, 0.15, and 0.40 is investigated up to 1200 {\deg}C and then compared to (Ti$_{0.56}$Al$_{0.44}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$. X-ray diffraction reveals a thermal stability limit of 1150 {\deg}C independent of the O concentration, as witnessed by the formation of decomposition products, namely h-Cr$_{2}$N for (Cr$_{0.50}$Al$_{0.50}$)$_{0.49}$N$_{0.51}$ and c-Cr for both (Cr$_{0.48}$Al$_{0.52}$)$_{0.48}$(O$_{0.15}$N$_{0.85}$)$_{0.52}$ and (Cr$_{0.44}$Al$_{0.56}$)$_{0.46}$(O$_{0.40}$N$_{0.60}$)$_{0.54}$. Based on TEM and ERDA data, the thermal stability limit is extended to 1100 - 1150 {\deg}C. DFT calculations indicate that bond breaking limits the thermal stability. In (Cr,Al)N, N has the lowest activation energy for migration. Furthermore, the O vacancy formation energy is highest in (Cr,Al)(O,N). It has to be overcome to enable diffusion on the non-metal sublattice, which is necessary for forming decomposition products like w-AlN or c-Cr. However, once Cr-N bonds break, decomposition into h-Cr$_{2}$N and subsequent c-Cr together with N$_{2}$ is triggered. This results in N evaporation, generating sufficient non-metal vacancies that greatly enhance diffusion and render the extensive vacancy formation energies for non-metals irrelevant. This reduction of the activation energy for mass transport on the non-metal sublattice to the migration barrier causes the similar thermal stability in (Cr$_{0.47 \mp 0.03}$Al$_{0.53 \mp 0.03}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$. In contrast, Al bonds break first without creating non-metal vacancies in (Ti,Al)(O,N). Thus, the high O vacancy formation energy in (Ti,Al)(O,N) significantly increases the thermal stability compared to (Ti,Al)N as well as the here investigated films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20691v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Manipulating ferroelectricity without electrical bias: A perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20703</link><description>arXiv:2601.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials are established candidates for beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, owing to their non-volatile spontaneous electrical polarization. The recent boom in electric dipole texture engineering and manipulation in such materials has revealed exciting routes for controlling ferroelectric polarization, offering alternatives to the classical, sometimes challenging, application of electrical fields. In this short perspective, we shed light on electrode-free external stimuli enabling control over polar states in thin films. We bring awareness to the polarizing role of chemically-engineered surface contributions and provide insights into the combination of chemical substitution and mechanical pressure, complementing the polar state tuning capabilities readily enabled by flexoelectricity. Finally, we describe recent developments in the optical modulation of polarization. Thus, our perspective aims to stimulate the advancement of alternative means to act on polarization states and facilitate the development of ferroelectric-based applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20703v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universality of Type-II Multiferroicity in Monolayer Nickel Dihalides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20713</link><description>arXiv:2601.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of type-II multiferroicity in monolayer NiI${_2}$ indicated a new pathway for intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling in the two-dimensional limit. However, determining whether this phenomenon is a unique anomaly or a general, chemically tunable property of the material class remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate the universality of type-II multiferroicity in the transition metal dihalides by visualizing the ferroelectric order in monolayer NiBr${_2}$. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we resolve atomic-scale ferroelectric domains and confirm their magnetoelectric origin through reciprocal manipulation experiments: reorienting magnetic order via electric fields and suppressing the electric polarization with external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we find that the multiferroic state in NiBr${_2}$ is energetically less robust than in its iodide counterpart, consistent with modified superexchange interactions and the reduced spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish the transition metal dihalides as a versatile platform where the stability of magnetoelectric phases can be engineered through chemical substitution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20836</link><description>arXiv:2601.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moir\'e materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moir\'e band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20708</link><description>arXiv:2601.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20708v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12153</link><description>arXiv:2508.12153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12153v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20865</link><description>arXiv:2503.20865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.20865v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AiiDA-TrainsPot: Towards automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11703</link><description>arXiv:2509.11703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crafting neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) remains a complex task, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce AiiDA-TrainsPot, an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs by orchestrating density-functional-theory calculations, data augmentation strategies, and classical molecular dynamics. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against ab initio reference errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of this calibrated criterion, and show that it minimizes both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to compute from first principles. AiiDA-TrainsPot has a modular design that supports multiple NNIP backends, enabling both the training of NNIPs from scratch and the fine-tuning of foundation models. We demonstrate its capabilities through automated training campaigns targeting pristine and defective carbon allotropes, including amorphous carbon, as well as structural phase transitions in monolayer $\mathrm{W_xMo_{1-x}Te_2}$ alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11703v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Spin Squeezing in Power-Law Interacting XXZ Models with Disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10703</link><description>arXiv:2601.10703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that it can also occur in systems with power-law interactions, enabling direct tests in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semiclassical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10703v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Defect-interface coupling for stable lattice-oxygen-driven oxygen evolution at industrial current densities</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68730-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 29 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68730-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68730-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The efficiency of large-scale hydrogen production is limited by slow oxygen evolution kinetics.

For the high Pb sample treated with MACl, continuous enhancement and suppression of analog-type conductance are achieved under direct current voltage sweep and voltage pulse stimulation, which shows 62.2% enhancement and 68.4% inhibition after long-term synaptic plasticity. The analog-type memristor also presents good spike voltage-dependent and frequency-dependent plasticities with a paired-pulse facilitation index of 55.5%. In contrast, for the low Pb sample treated with MACl, the lattice distortion and crystal defects are further decreased, leading to a sudden change of digital-type resistance in the current−voltage curve.

Significant efforts have been devoted to creating new experimental systems demonstrating dendrite growth that can be used as models for deep experimental study of the process.

We achieved dendrite growth in lithium niobate LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals with an artificial surface dielectric layer at elevated temperatures. The nonequilibrium switching conditions caused by incomplete screening of the depolarization field suppress the usual faceted domain growth. Up to six branching generations were observed, with a branch width below 100 nm. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;In situ&lt;/span&gt; optical imaging allowed dendrite evolution to be studied at millisecond temporal resolution. Our investigation into dendrite formation was based on an analogy between crystal and domain growth. Upon development of a corresponding computational model, we demonstrated that uniaxial ferroelectrics represent a promising model system for the experimental study of dendrite growth. Likewise, a wide range of driving parameters and a high spatial resolution help provide new insights into the general laws of the formation of dendrite patterns.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011415/3378300/Experimental-and-theoretical-study-of-solid-solid</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Non‐Volatile Phase Modulation with Ultralow Energy Consumption Enabled by 2D Ferroelectric/TMD Heterostructures</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202520795?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:54:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202520795</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia] Phase Transition of NaNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Antiferroelectric Ceramics: Doping research based on DFT calculation</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135964542600073X?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 26 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Acta Materialia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Yile Yang, Jing Shang, Jinbo Zhang, Pengfan Lv, Jiachen Li, Yiting Hui, Lei Zhang, Min Chen, Shaobin Zhang, Man Yu, Yongping Pu&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:33:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135964542600073X</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Catalytic Capability of Graphene/Cu Heterostructures for Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activated by the Synergistic Effect of Defects and Strain</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c04627</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c04627/asset/images/medium/jp5c04627_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry C&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c04627&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:03:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c04627</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents] Direct Air Capture and Photoconversion of CO2 to Ethylene by Defect‐Tailored Cu3‐Based Metal–Organic Frameworks</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202516438?af=R</link><description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 5, 28 January 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:02:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/anie.202516438</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Manipulation of Abnormal Thermal Conductance at the Graphene/SiC Interface through Topological Defects</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c07216</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c07216/asset/images/medium/jp5c07216_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry C&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c07216&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:58:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c07216</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] C2NP: A Benchmark for Learning Scale-Dependent Geometric Invariances in 3D Materials Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19076</link><description>arXiv:2601.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for materials have achieved strong performance on periodic bulk crystals, yet their ability to generalize across scale transitions to finite nanostructures remains largely untested. We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery.

Abstract: Altermagnets, a class of collinear magnets defined by their spin-split electronic bands, are a focus of intense research, where a key challenge is to experimentally verify this unique band structure as a bulk property. Here, we report a comprehensive quantum oscillation study on the prototypical altermagnet CrSb. By combining high-field magnetotransport and torque measurements with DFT+$U$ calculations including spin-orbit coupling, we successfully identify a multitude of quantum-oscillation frequencies originating from four spin-non-degenerate bands. These results provide definitive, bulk-sensitive evidence for the altermagnetic spin-split Fermi surface of CrSb, which provides a firm foundation for exploring its novel electronic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19105v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic and Electronic Structure of Strongly Charged Domain Walls in van der Waals {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19137</link><description>arXiv:2601.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we use atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first principles calculations to study the atomic and electronic structure of strongly charged domain walls in $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$. STEM imaging and density functional theory (DFT) show that head-to-head (HH) domain walls contain a layer of nonpolar $\beta$-In$_2$Se$_3$, whereas tail-to-tail (TT) domain walls are atomically abrupt. We apply 4D STEM and multislice electron ptychography to map ferroelectric domains in 2D and 3D, showing that nearly $180^\circ$ domain walls exhibit complex, curved 3D structures that differ from ideal $180^\circ$ structures. Band structure calculations show localized conducting states within a $\sim$ 1 nm thick layer at both HH and TT domain walls, such as a midgap state at the $\beta$ layer of the HH domain wall. These properties make strongly charged domain walls in $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ excellent candidates for realizing 2D electron or hole gases and domain wall engineering in van der Waals ferroelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19137v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry Adapted Analysis of Screw Dislocation: Electronic Structure and Carrier Recombination Mechanisms in GaN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19240</link><description>arXiv:2601.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As fundamental one-dimensional defects, screw dislocations profoundly reshape the energy landscape and carrier dynamics of crystalline materials. By restoring the exact algebra of the screw dislocation group, we unveil the latent symmetry constraints that govern the electronic structure, providing a more rigorous physical picture than the conventional treatments. When applied to GaN, the method yields a band-connectivity constraint and rigorous dipole selection rules for polarization-resolved transitions. Combined with computed Hamiltonian matrix, the approach gives symmetry-filtered radiative and dielectric calculations and reveals a piezoelectrical effect at the dislocation core that strongly suppresses radiative recombination. The pronounced dominance of non-radiative capture over radiative recombination highlights the detrimental impact of screw dislocations on the luminous efficiency of GaN, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing dislocation-limited optoelectronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular Hamiltonian learning from setpoint-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19371</link><description>arXiv:2601.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular quantum magnets adsorbed on surfaces exhibit rich spin and orbital excitations that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (STM-IETS). However, the quantitative extraction of the underlying multiorbital Hamiltonian from experimental spectra remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19371v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mapping optical, chemical, structural features in ZrO2 via cross-sectional SEM-Cathodoluminescence correlation microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19428</link><description>arXiv:2601.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how nanoscale heterogeneities influence charge transport and mass transfer in oxides is critical for developing advanced materials for energy and electronic uses. In high-temperature applications, the formation of thermal oxides with complex chemical and structural features plays a central role in material lifetime. While thermally grown zirconia (ZrO2) on zirconium alloys exhibits strong chemical and microstructural gradients across the oxide thickness, linking these heterogeneities to electronic-defect landscapes remains challenging. We demonstrate cross-sectional scanning electron microscope-cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) as a mesoscale probe of spatial variations in luminescence in zirconia and establish correlations with co-registered electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) on the same region. The SEM-CL signal is dominated by the ~2.7 eV defect band, but its intensity varies strongly across the oxide cross section. Correlative EBSD-CL analysis reveals that CL intensity increases with grain area and decreases at the grain boundaries, consistent with enhanced non-radiative recombination associated with microstructural disorder. EPMA mapping shows that a substantial fraction of CL-dark features co-localize with secondary phase precipitates enriched in iron. These results show that SEM-CL contrast in corrosion-grown ZrO2 is controlled by both chemical heterogeneity and microstructural disorder, underscoring the need for correlative registration to interpret CL images. This multi-modal approach provides an efficient route to connect electronic properties and luminescence signatures across complex oxide cross sections to underlying chemistry and microstructure, thereby providing a pathway to relate local defect landscapes to regions likely to bias electronic/ionic transport during oxidation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge redistribution at metal-ZrO2 interfaces: A combined DFT and continuum electrostatic study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19436</link><description>arXiv:2601.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale metallic inclusions (NMIs) are commonly observed within oxide scales formed during high-temperature oxidation, revealing the existence of chemical and electronic heterogeneity beyond conventional corrosion theories that assume homogeneous, fully oxidized films. Using tetragonal zirconia (tZrO2) facing a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals as the model system, this work investigates the short-range and long-range charge redistributions across metal-oxide interfaces by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with continuum modeling. We show that metal-oxide contact induces a short-range charge redistribution confined to a few atomic layers and a long-range redistribution of space charge that can extend over macroscopic distances within weakly doped oxides. DFT calculations show that the short-range redistribution is dominated by metal induced gap states (MIGS) in tZrO2 facing noble metals like Au and Ag, and by chemical bonding in tZrO2 facing active metals like Al. DFT-informed continuum theoretical analysis shows that the range of space-charge redistribution is governed by the doping level of tZrO2, and that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) exhibits a stronger dependence on the metal work function than the doping level. Both the short-range and long-range charge redistributions can alter the transport of charge carriers via their associated electric fields, extending several nm to hundreds of nm from the interface, depending on the doping concentrations, suggesting possible heterogeneous oxide growth caused by NMIs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19436v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Analytical solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials: Universal three-body parameter of mixed-dimensional Efimov states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19517</link><description>arXiv:2601.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $1/r^3$ and attractive $1/r^2$ potentials. Using the quantum defect theory, we obtain analytical solutions for both repulsive and attractive $1/r^3$ interactions. The obtained discrete-scale-invariant energies and wave functions, validated by excellent agreement with numerical results, provide a natural framework for describing the universality of Efimov states in mixed dimension. Specifically, we consider a three-body system consisting of two heavy particles with large dipole moments confined to a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and resonantly interacting with an unconfined light particle. With the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this system is effectively reduced to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $1/r^3$ and $1/r^2$ potentials, and manifests the Efimov effect. Our analytical solution suggests that, for repulsive dipole interactions, the three-body parameter of the mixed-dimensional Efimov states is universally set by the dipolar length scale, whereas for attractive interactions it explicitly depends on the short-range phase. We also investigate the effects of finite transverse confinement and find that our analytical results are useful for describing the Efimov states composed of two polar molecules and a light atom.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dual-Switch Control of a Layer-Locked Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in a Sliding Ferroelectric Antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19556</link><description>arXiv:2601.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders in twodimensional (2D) materials provides a promising avenue for the nonvolatile control of coupled spin and valley degrees of freedom, a capability central to advancing spinvalleytronics. However, realizing a single material system where these quantum states can be independently and reversibly manipulated by distinct stimuli, a prerequisite for multifunctional devices, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a dual-switch mechanism in bilayer VS2, a room-temperature FE-AFM system, that enables electrical and magnetic control of a layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). First-principles calculations reveal that interlayer sliding breaks spatial inversion symmetry, inducing a switchable out-of-plane FE polarization that coexists with interlayer AFM. The spin-orbit coupled valley polarization can be reversibly switched either by FE polarization reversal or by a magnetic-field-induced spin-flip transition, confirming the existence of electrically and magnetically addressable valley states. The Berry curvature exhibits both valley-contrasting and layer-locked characteristics, which underpin a switchable Hall response. Notably, electric and magnetic switching are functionally equivalent in modulating valley, layer, and spin indices, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a multidegree-of-freedom operational paradigm in 2D multiferroics and opens a viable design pathway toward multi-state memory and spin-valleytronic logic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] All-electrical switching of spin texture in a strain-tunable 2D Janus ferroelectric altermagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19560</link><description>arXiv:2601.19560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a collinear magnetic phase with momentum-dependent spin splitting, is a promising candidate for strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, realizing direct and tunable coupling between ferroelectricity (FE) and AM within a single two-dimensional (2D) material remains an outstanding challenge. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we identify the distorted phase of monolayer Janus VOClBr as an intrinsic 2D FE-AM. This phase demonstrates robust magnetoelectric coupling, as evidenced by a complete reversal of momentum-space spin polarization upon FE switching, and further supported by spin texture analysis and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Notably, the FE properties are highly strain-tunable: biaxial compression strain of -4% reduces the FE polarization switching barrier by approximately 87%, whereas a tensile strain of +3% induces a phase transition to an antiferromagnet. Leveraging the lock-in between the electrically controlled spin texture and the magneto-optical Kerr effect signal, we propose a non-volatile, polymorphic spintronic memory device featuring all-electrical writing and optical readout. This work establishes 2D FE-AMs as a versatile platform for coupled ferroic orders and paves the way for voltage-controlled, multifunctional spin-logic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lanthanide-Dependent Clustering in Yb$^{3+}$/Ln$^{3+}$ Co-Doped CaF$_2$ Nanocrystals: Correlating Spectroscopic Signatures with DFT Insights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19566</link><description>arXiv:2601.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of heterogeneous lanthanide-ion clusters in CaF$_2$ was investigated experimentally and computationally. CaF$_2$ nanoparticles co-doped with 20~mol\% Yb$^{3+}$ and 2~mol\% Ln$^{3+}$ (Ln$^{3+}$ = Ce$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, Nd$^{3+}$, Sm$^{3+}$, Eu$^{3+}$, Gd$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, and Tm$^{3+}$) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological properties were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. High-resolution Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy revealed the presence of Yb$^{3+}$ isolated cubic centers and various cluster sites. The relative concentration of the clusters varied with the choice of the co-doping ion. Calculations based on density functional theory were used to estimate the formation energies and local coordination structures of different clusters. The calculations indicate that the neutral $C_{4v}$ aggregations containing Ln$^{3+}$ tend to decrease across the lanthanide series, while the negatively charged derivatives of hexameric clusters are relatively constant.

Abstract: A recent study has established the Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathode as a highly efficient emitter of spin-polarized electrons. However, the electronic structure of alkali antimonides remains poorly understood. In this work, we report the first crystalline epitaxial growth of Na$_2$KSb films, achieved via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a graphene-coated SiC(0001) substrate. The high crystalline quality of these films enabled a direct investigation of the material's electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). By comparing the experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have identified dispersive surface states originating from different terminations of the Na$_2$KSb(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the crystalline order of the film is preserved following its activation via the deposition of Cs and Sb. This finding opens a pathway for investigating the electronic structure of multialkali Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathodes and for rationally improving their properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19652v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing Spin Defects via Single Spin Relaxometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09432</link><description>arXiv:2504.09432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and optical addressability. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance indirectly via changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, eliminating the need for optical excitation or fluorescence detection of the $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$. Cross-relaxation between NV and $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling quantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical diffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Our method demonstrates interactions between 3D and 2D spin sensors, establishing NV centers as versatile probes for characterizing otherwise inaccessible spin defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.09432v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Link Statistics of Dislocation Network during Strain Hardening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03743</link><description>arXiv:2509.03743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystals that multiply and self-organize into a complex network during strain hardening. The length of dislocation links, connecting neighboring nodes within this network, contains crucial information about the evolving dislocation microstructure. By analyzing data from Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations in face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu, we characterize the statistical distribution of link lengths of dislocation networks during strain hardening on individual slip systems. Our analysis reveals that link lengths on active slip systems follow a double-exponential distribution, while those on inactive slip systems conform to a single-exponential distribution. The distinctive long tail observed in the double-exponential distribution is attributed to the stress-induced bowing out of long links on active slip systems, a feature that disappears upon removal of the applied stress. We further demonstrate that both observed link length distributions can be explained by extending a one-dimensional Poisson process to include different growth functions. Specifically, the double-exponential distribution emerges when the growth rate for links exceeding a critical length becomes super-linear, which aligns with the physical phenomenon of long links bowing out under stress. This work advances our understanding of dislocation microstructure evolution during strain hardening and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing its formation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03743v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21778</link><description>arXiv:2509.21778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/PRDNet.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21778v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Textures in Zr-Substituted Barium Titanate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26023</link><description>arXiv:2509.26023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 hotspots, termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized effective Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3 quarks). The two share the same six-vortex scaffold (threefold motif) but differ in the core-level polarization texture, resulting in an integer +1 per vortex offset in the plane-integrated (slice) topological charge. In random BZT, nanodomains remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass-like state with fluctuations of the topological charge along the nanodomain axis. Thermal stability maps show that pure barium titanate retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the collapse temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly, the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26023v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Following the Long-Term Evolution of sp$^3$-type Defects in Tritiated Graphene using Raman Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16168</link><description>arXiv:2511.16168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the evolution of tritium-induced sp$^3$-defects in monolayer graphene on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate, by comparing large-area Raman maps of the same two samples, acquired just after fabrication and twice thereafter, about 9-12 months apart. Inbetween measurements the samples were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Using a conservative classification of sp$^3$-type spectra, based on the D/D' peak intensity ratio, we observed almost complete depletion of sp$^3$-type defects over the investigation period of about two years. This by far exceeds the ~5.5% annual reduction expected from tritium decay alone (~3x larger). This change in the defect composition is accompanied by a recovery of the 2D-band of graphene and an overall decrease in defect-density, as determined via the D/G intensity ratio. Hydogenated graphene is reported to be reasonably stable over several months, when kept under vacuum, but suffers substantial hydrogen loss under laboratory air conditions. While the results shown here for tritiated graphene exhibit similarities with hydrogenated graphene, however, some distinct differences are observed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16168v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hydrogen diffusion in TiCr$_2$H$_x$ Laves phases: A combined ab initio and machine-learning-potential study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18069</link><description>arXiv:2511.18069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ (0 &lt; $x$ &lt;= 4) Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18069v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Polarization-modulated programmable photovoltaic performance of a designed ferroelectric heterojunction</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68853-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 28 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68853-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68853-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The authors design a Pt/CuInP2S6/graphene heterostructure that achieves polarity-switchable photovoltaic current modulated by ferroelectric polarization.

Abstract: Potassium niobate (KNbO3) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric with large electro-optic and nonlinear optical responses, high optical damage thresholds and a rich sequence of temperature-driven phase transformations, making it a promising platform for tunable photonic devices. In this work, we develop a thermodynamic model for the coupled ferroelectric and optical properties of KNbO3. By separating the total polarization into lattice and electronic contributions, the model provides a unified description of both the anisotropic ferroelectric and optical properties. The thermodynamic coefficients are determined by fitting to experimental measurements of the spontaneous polarization, dielectric susceptibilities, lattice parameters, and refractive indices. Without any further fitting, the model quantitatively predicts the temperature dependence of the electro-optic and piezoelectric coefficients in close agreement with experimental measurements. By utilizing the electronic polarization equation of motion, the model further captures the optical dispersion in the near infrared to visible spectrum. This work provides the thermodynamic foundation for future studies of coupled ferroelectric and optical phenomena in KNbO3.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Polarization Switching of Piezoelectric Films due to Proximity of Ferroelectric Nanoclusters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17214</link><description>arXiv:2601.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire thermodynamical approach and finite element modelling, we studied the influence of nanoclusters shape on the polarization switching and domain nucleation emerging in otherwise non-switchable piezoelectric films due to the proximity of ferroelectric nanoclusters. The boundary of the ferroelectric nanocluster embedded in the piezoelectric film is a compositionally graded layer. We analyzed the conditions, which allow switching the electric polarization of the piezoelectric AlN film at coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field due to the proximity of ferroelectric Al1-xScxN clusters. Due to proximity effect, the spontaneous polarization switches in all elements of the nanopatterned film, and corresponding coercive fields can be reduced significantly in the presence of spike-like Al1-xScxN clusters. We also explored the underlaying physical mechanisms of the proximity effects in the piezoelectric films with ferroelectric nanoclusters. The internal field, which is depolarizing inside the piezoelectric film (due to the larger spontaneous polarization of AlN) and polarizing in the ferroelectric cluster (due to the smaller spontaneous polarization of Al1-xScxN), lowers the potential barrier in the clusters and facilitates the instant growth of nanodomains (emerging in the clusters) through the piezoelectric film. Since considered nanostructured materials can be created by implantation of Sc ions into AlN films, obtained theoretical results can be useful for creation of nanopatterned ferroelectrics by chemical engineering, with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable ferroelectric memory technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17214v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-protected topological polarons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17235</link><description>arXiv:2601.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent quasiparticles in solids often exhibit unique topological properties as a result of the complex interplay between charge, orbital, spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Among these quasiparticles, the polaron occupies a special place as the first known manifestation of the interaction between a fermion and a boson field. While polarons have been investigated for almost a century, whether these quasiparticles exhibit topological properties and why remain open questions. Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classfication by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class. For these materials, we compute the fingerprints of polaron topology in Huang diffuse scattering, and propose ultrafast electron and X-ray scattering experiments to detect these quasiparticles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17235v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Interface Structure using the Minima Hopping Method with a Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17291</link><description>arXiv:2601.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting atomic-scale interfacial structures remains a central challenge in materials science due to their structural complexity and the difficulty of direct comparison between computational and experimental results. In this study, we present an efficient approach for interface structure prediction that integrates the Minima Hopping Method (MHM) with the state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), Allegro. We demonstrate that the MHM-Allegro approach provides a robust and computationally efficient route for predicting interfacial structures in the benchmark system SrTiO3 Sigma 3 (112)[110] tilt grain boundaries (GBs), consistently identifying the lowest-energy configurations across different stoichiometries. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy for constructing defect-representative training datasets without explicitly including defective configurations, achieving excellent extrapolative performance in interface predictions. The predictive capability is further validated through direct comparison with experimental observations of the SrTiO3 Sigma 5 (310)[001] GB, where the predicted atomic configurations show strong agreement with experimental measurements. This work represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between ab initio predictions and experimentally observed interfacial structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17291v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Erbium Probes of Magnetic Order in a Layered van der Waals Material</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17516</link><description>arXiv:2601.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in characterizing magnetic order and dynamics in two-dimensional magnets, yet most efforts to date rely on external probes that interrogate the sample from tens of nanometers away and inevitably average over that length scale. Here we use internal, lattice-embedded Er3+ defects in CrSBr as atomic-scale probes, accessing their telecom-band photoluminescence with spectroscopy and temperature-dependent confocal imaging to read out magnetism from within the material. At room temperature we observe narrow, long-lived photoluminescence (PL) lines in the telecom band, characteristic of erbium emitters. Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary. Further, a moderate in-plane field of 0.3 T shifts the PL minimum by +8 K, which we tentatively associate to field-biased ferromagnetic correlations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Instability-driven mechanically locked states in functional oxide membranes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17959</link><description>arXiv:2601.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical instabilities in thin solids offer a powerful route to engineer nonlinear responses, yet their controlled use in functional crystalline oxides has remained largely unexplored. Notably, by changing the aspect ratio of solids, the energy landscape around equilibrium can be modified to induce non-linearities under lateral stresses through non-lateral deformations. These nonlinear systems can develop multiple local energy minima where the system can settle and switch between states through the application of a driving force. Crucially, recent advances in oxide thin film growth have enabled the fabrication of freestanding oxide membranes, paving a viable path for their use in bistable architecture, particularly at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate that freestanding oxide membranes, such as SrTiO3 (STO) and BaTiO3 (BTO), relax into well-defined metastable buckling states when transferred onto lithographically defined cavities. The membrane deformation is determined by the interplay between built-in residual strain, bending stiffness, and cavity geometry, resulting in reproducible bistable states with distinct strain distributions. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy, in-contact Kelvin probe measurements, and finite-element modelling, we reveal that these mechanically locked states directly shape the electromechanical potential landscape of ferroelectric BaTiO3. We further demonstrate reversible snapthrough transitions between mechanically degenerate states, establishing complex oxides as deterministic, geometry-tunable building blocks for nonlinear nanoelectromechanical architectures. Our results illustrate a general strategy for exploiting mechanical instabilities to encode and manipulate functional responses in ultrathin crystalline membranes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thicker amorphous grain boundary complexions reduce plastic strain localization in nanocrystalline Cu-Zr</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18059</link><description>arXiv:2601.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous grain boundary complexions have been shown to increase the plasticity of nanocrystalline alloys as compared to ordered grain boundaries. Here, the effect of an important structural descriptor, amorphous complexion thickness, on the plasticity and failure modes of nanocrystalline Cu-Zr is studied with in-situ compression testing, with over 50 micropillars tested. Two model materials were created that differ only in their complexion thickness, with one having a thicker complexion population than the other. The sample with thinner complexions was more likely to experience non-uniform plastic deformation in the form of localized plastic flow or shear banding. In contrast, the sample with thicker complexions displayed more homogeneous plasticity and higher damage tolerance; thicker amorphous complexions suppress localization by absorbing defects. This work demonstrates that increasing complexion thickness can be beneficial for stable plastic flow in nanocrystalline alloys, by improving resistance to strain localization and premature failure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18059v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Functionalities of Au2O, Au2O3, Au2O3-x, and nanosheets, including spontaneous polarization, using DFT and hybrid functional</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18165</link><description>arXiv:2601.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used density functional theories (DFT) to investigate the properties of Au2O and Au2O3-x (x = 00.08) to reveal their remarkable functionalities. Hybrid functional theories accurately estimate the band gap (Eg) of oxides, and the present hybrid functional calculations determined Eg values of 0.96 eV for Au2O and 2.86 eV for Au2O3, which is &gt;300% of the commonly accepted Eg of Au2O3 (0.85 eV). Moreover, we discovered spontaneous polarization (PS) in Au2O3, which is unusually large and advantageous for catalysis. The PS was retained even in 2-nm-thick Au2O3 nanosheets, similar to hyperferroelectric, generating a potential of 0.6 eV despite screening caused by surface reconstruction, which is a novel screening mechanism. Below a thickness of 0.8 nm, the PS vanished, and inversion symmetry emerged at 0.4 nm, suggesting a new approach to finding a paraelectric phase. Au2O was supersoft under shear distortion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18165v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate semiempirical analytical formulas for spontaneous polarization by crystallographic parameters of SrTiO3-BaTiO3 system by ab initio calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18181</link><description>arXiv:2601.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous polarizations (PSs) of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 under various conditions are calculated ab initio using different exchange-correlation functionals. The extensive theoretical sets of PS vs. ion positions are found to lie on a single curve, despite the chemical differences and the wide variations of PS and lattice parameters. This uncovers accurate simple analytical formulas of PS of SrTiO3-BaTiO3 system expressed by ion positions; a single formula predicts both macroscopic and atomic-scale PS of SrTiO3, BaTiO3 and SrTiO3-BaTiO alloys. The accuracy of the formula is demonstrated by the application to experiments, BaTiO3-SrTiO3 (-CaTiO3) alloys, Sr4Ti4O12 with PS // a-axis, a parallel domain, and a headon domain. In addition, the present results verify empirically that oxygen displacement is the primary identifier and the origin of PS of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 and indicate that BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 may transforms into new state by an extremely large strain, e.g., -3%. Furthermore, the earlier prediction of headon domain without aid of defects was confirmed. The present procedures for finding formulas can be applied to other materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Interface Stability in RENi2/Ni through First-Principles Calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18196</link><description>arXiv:2601.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallographic orientation analysis revealed that DyNi2 grew epitaxially on Ni, whereas NdNi2 does not. To elucidate the microscopic origin of this contrasting behavior, we constructed atomistic models of Ni/Rare-earth (RE)Ni2 interfaces with well-defined crystallographic alignment and performed first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).
  The computed interfacial energies exhibit a clear correlation with lattice mismatch: larger mismatch leads to higher interfacial energy and reduced interface stability. Consequently, Ni/DyNi2 exhibits a significantly lower interfacial energy than Ni/NdNi2, consistent with experimental observations.
  A comparison between interfacial and strain energies for Ni/RENi2 (RE = Sc, Y, Nd, Gd, Dy, and Lu) reveals that the elemental dependence of interfacial stability is dominated by elastic strain rather than chemical bonding. Based on this insight, we developed a simple regression model using the absolute lattice mismatch as a descriptor, enabling qualitative predictions of stability for Ni/RENi2 interfaces with RE other than those examined in DFT.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Separating Energy and Entropy Contributions to the Hexatic-Liquid Transitions in Two-Dimensional Repulsive Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18215</link><description>arXiv:2601.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, research on two-dimensional melting has established that both first-order and continuous hexatic-liquid transitions can occur, influenced by various factors in the potential energy and system details. The fundamental thermodynamic origins of this sensitivity remains elusive. Here, by decomposing the Helmholtz free energy across three representative repulsive systems, we reveal a universal competition between energy and entropy that dictates the melting pathway. The energetic contribution consistently imparts convexity to the free energy, whereas entropy imparts concavity. A first-order transition occurs when concave entropy dominates; otherwise, the transition is continuous. Further decomposition shows that vibrational entropy drives the concave total entropic curvature, while the configurational entropy's curvature switches from convex (first-order) to concave (continuous), mirroring defect proliferation measured by Shannon entropy. The convexity of the energy is dominated by the inherent potential, with minimal vibrational influence. Finally, we predict and verify that the first-order transition becomes continuous at zero temperature, where entropic effects vanish. Our work establishes the curvature of different thermodynamic quantities as a fundamental principle for understanding the nature of two-dimensional melting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active topological strings in renewing nematopolar fluids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18307</link><description>arXiv:2601.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter often simultaneously exhibits different kinds of orientational order and, in many cases of biological interest, undergoes continuous material renewal. In renewing nematopolar fluids we find stable topological strings, structures consisting of two nematic point defects connected by a defect line in the polar field. We identify the mechanism underlying string stabilization and unveil how string length is determined. In the presence of active stress, we observe active-string chaos. Our work identifies continuous material renewal as a generic mechanism underlying the stabilization of topological defect structures in systems with mixed order parameters. It could be used for orchestrating living matter during development and other biological processes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effect of ballistic re-solution on the nucleation kinetics of precipitates in diluted binary alloys under irradiation.

Abstract: The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We significantly extend this analogy by introducing an electronic analogue of Fourier optics dubbed as Fourier electron optics (FEO) with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a defect region, as well as the moir\'{e} pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating wider applicability of FEO of MDF.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.11259v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Soft symmetries of topological orders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link><description>arXiv:2501.03314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.03314v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong lead-free bioinspired piezoceramics for durable energy transducers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15382</link><description>arXiv:2508.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 10- to 15-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains originate from anisotropic residual stress fields, revealed by Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which delay crack initiation events. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15382v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton-polaron Umklapp scattering in Wigner crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11914</link><description>arXiv:2601.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11914v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14258</link><description>arXiv:2404.14258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively.

Abstract: Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer opportunities not found in conventional isotropic nanocubes, especially in producing linearly polarized light, as well as enhancing outcoupling through control over the transition dipole moment. But this requires ultrathin nanoplatelets with three or fewer monolayers of PbI6 octahedra across the thickness, which are challenging to synthesise uniformly, and their luminescence is strongly affected by surface defects. Together, these limit the performance of ultrathin PeNPLs in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. We demonstrate that ligands with phosphoryl functional groups strongly bind to the perovskite surface, while having an organic backbone that is not sterically bulky ensures high ligand density. By modulating nucleation and growth, these ancillary ligands lead to monodisperse PeNPLs that stack more uniformly when self-assembled into superlattices, with suppressed agglomeration. As a result, from edge-up PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced degree of polarization, while from face-down PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced outcoupling that results in LEDs with 13.1% external quantum efficiency, the highest reported for ultrathin PeNPL LEDs. This work establishes ancillary ligand-induced synthesis as a decisive route to achieve uniform nanoplatelets with robust orientation control, enabling full utilization of the multifunctionality of anisotropic PeNPLs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11107v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Facet-modulated ferroelectric polymers</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68855-w</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 27 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68855-w"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68855-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This study achieves precise atomic-scale control over ferroelectric polymer chains through facet modulation, significantly enhancing ferroelectric phase stability, thereby enabling efficient and tunable multiband electromagnetic attenuation.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68855-w</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] Kinetics and mechanism of light-driven methane decomposition on nickel/nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00622-8?rss=yes</link><description>This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using light to drive methane decomposition to produce only hydrogen gas and solid carbon by-product on a Ni/N-MWCNT catalyst.

Given the high attenuation and diversity of aging concrete structures, we use a piezoelectric and laser ultrasonic system combining broadband ultrasonic transmission (up to several hundred kHz) with two-dimensional scanning reception using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). This system, originally developed for imaging less attenuative metallic samples, is adapted here for highly attenuative materials like concrete. During the propagation of ultrasonic waves in highly attenuative materials, such as concrete, the high-frequency components of a broadband incident wave are preferably attenuated. As a result, the frequency components of the surviving wave change depending on the attenuation of materials. Although the remaining frequency changes depending on concrete structures, the LDV with a broad reception bandwidth can receive such waves regardless of the degree of attenuation. This enables the automatic frequency adaptation in 3D imaging. After confirming the broadband transmission, we demonstrate the 3D imaging capabilities for different attenuative materials (i.e., mortar with delamination and carbon fiber-reinforced concrete with a slit). The proposed method would be useful for improving the maintenance management of aging concrete structures with unknown ultrasonic attenuation.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/044101/3378085/Auto-frequency-adaptive-3D-ultrasonic-phased-array</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Radiative Defects in Chloride-Activated CdSe Thin Films</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03191</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03191/asset/images/medium/nz5c03191_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03191&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 20:11:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03191</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Temperature-Responsive Xylene Isomer Separation via Biomimetic Window Confinement and Defect-Engineered Nanospace in Metal–Organic Frameworks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c18835</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c18835/asset/images/medium/nn5c18835_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c18835&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:47:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c18835</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: We report first-principles calculations of the electronic structure, magnon excitations, and phonons in magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), jacobsite (MnFe$_2$O$_4$), and mixed manganese-zinc ferrites (Mn$_{x}$,Zn$_{1-x}$)Fe$_2$O$_4$ for representative compositions ($0\le x \le 1$) and A/B-site cation arrangements. Electronic structures are computed using density functional theory (DFT) augmented by rotationally invariant DFT+U+J, with on-site Hubbard and Hund's parameters, $U$ and $J$, respectively, determined self-consistently by spin-polarized linear-response perturbations of the chosen correlated subspaces (including, where applied, the ligand $2p$ subspace). A classical Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian is parameterized by mapping DFT+U+J total energies for multiple collinear spin configurations onto nearest-neighbor exchange couplings, which are then used to obtain magnon dispersions and magnon densities of states within linear spin-wave theory. Phonon spectra and densities of states are obtained from finite-displacement force constants and dynamical matrices computed on the same DFT+U+J-relaxed structures. Overall, the workflow provides a consistent, composition- and configuration-aware route to electronic, vibrational, and magnetic excitation spectra across the Mn/Zn ferrite space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anharmonic thermodynamics redefines metastability and parent phases in ferroelectric HfO2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16420</link><description>arXiv:2601.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnia (HfO2) is a silicon-compatible dielectric material, yet stabilizing its desired but metastable ferroelectric phase remains challenging. Phase stability predictions by density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial guidance, but most simulations neglected or only treated finite temperature effects with (quasi-)harmonic approximation due to high computational cost of DFT. Here, we develop a machine learning force field and perform thermodynamic calculations for HfO2 using self-consistent phonon theory to address growing evidence of anharmonicity. Our results reveal that the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase oIII exhibits metastability below 0.1kBT under most conditions within the simulated regime of temperature and pressure (600 K &lt;= T &lt;= 1500 K and 0 &lt;= p &lt;= 7.5 GPa), contradicting previous harmonic predictions of metastability above 1500 K at ambient pressure. We further report evidence for temperature- and pressure-dependent ferroelectric parent phase despite efforts to identify a universal one. This study highlights the importance of anharmonicity and provides an effective approach for its treatment in the design of HfO2-based ferroelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dielectric, magnetic and lattice dynamics properties of double perovskite (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16524</link><description>arXiv:2601.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent dielectric and magnetic studies of (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 ceramics [A.A. Belik, Chem. Mater. 36, 7604 (2024)] have classified this material as a rare hybrid multiferroic, with both antiferromagnetic and (anti)ferroelectric ordering occurring at the same temperature of 22 K. The pronounced dielectric anomaly observed at this temperature indicated that the structural change is primarily induced by a phonon soft mode and not by a spin arrangement, as is usually the case in type II multiferroics. However, our comprehensive investigation involving new ceramic samples as well as the sample from the above-mentioned reference does not support this conclusion. Low-temperature polarization measurements revealed no evidence of either ferroelectric or antiferroelectric order in both sample series. The dielectric permittivity exhibits only a slight change at the antiferromagnetic transition, and phonon modes observed in IR and Raman spectra show no indication of a symmetry change at low temperatures. In the new samples the Neel temperature is shifted to TN = 18 K. XRD, SEM, EDS and WDS analyses confirmed the composition (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 of both ceramics, but also indicated a small amount (percentage points) of MnO and CaO impurities in the sample from the previous publication and Mn3O4, CaWO4 secondary phases (&lt;4%) in the new ceramics. The differences in dielectric and magnetic properties of the two samples can therefore be explained by their different chemical purity. The small dielectric anomaly of the new sample at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is explained by a spin-phonon coupling. We conclude that (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 is not a multiferroic, but a paraelectric antiferromagnet.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16524v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Role of defects in the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases at asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16611</link><description>arXiv:2601.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries can exist as different grain boundary phases (also called complexions) with individual atomic structures. The thermodynamics of these defect phases in high-angle grain boundaries were studied mostly with atomistic and phase field computer simulations, but almost exclusively for special, symmetric boundaries. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations combined with structure search methods, as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments to take a step towards understanding more general grain boundaries. Using the example of $\Sigma$37c $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt boundaries in Cu, we show how the grain boundary phase transition on a symmetric boundary plane is changed by the geometrically necessary defects introduced in inclined, asymmetric boundaries. We analyze the disconnections - which are dislocation-like line defects of grain boundaries - both in the simulations, as well as in experimental Cu and Al samples. A main finding is that defect energies can have a major influence on the stability of grain boundary phases, even at small inclinations. Furthermore, some defects are not able to effect large inclinations. At that point, defective asymmetric GB phases compete with grain boundaries faceting into the adjacent symmetric GB phases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16611v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering the electronic structure of TiO$_2$ by transition metal doping: A First Principles DFT Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16735</link><description>arXiv:2601.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we perform a comparative analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal-doped TiO$_2$. The electronic band gaps of Ti$_x$M$_{1-x}$O$_2$, where M represents 3d-transition metals such as Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn have been determined using the PBE functional within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) scheme, and also using the hybrid HSE06 functional. In the context of pure TiO$_2$, the partial density of states (PDOS) reveals that the electronic band gap emerges between the O-2p and Ti-3d orbitals. It is suggested that the Ti-3d ($t_{2g}$) states play a more prominent role in bonding compared to the Ti-3d ($e_g$) states. We performed DFT calculations to investigate the impact of doping with other 3d transition metal atoms, leading to the emergence of impurity states within the band gap. The hybridization between the oxygen 2p orbitals and the titanium 3d orbitals in TiO$_2$ is altered by the introduction of doping with 3d transition metals because of the change in the oxidation state of titanium, shifting from solely 4+ to a combination of 4+ and 3+ states. The calculation of spin-polarized density demonstrates the emergence of ferromagnetic properties, particularly in titanium dioxide doped with chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) with large magnetic moments. Our work demonstrates the significant impact of doping transition metals on TiO$_2$, allowing for the precise manipulation of electrical and magnetic properties, and thus holds great potential for the development of spin-based memory devices with possible neuromorphic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Controlling Mixed Mo/MoS$_2$ Domains on Si by Molecular Beam Epitaxy for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16738</link><description>arXiv:2601.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is a prototypical layered transition-metal dichalcogenide whose electrocatalytic performance is governed by a delicate balance between crystallinity, defect density, and electronic conductivity. Here we report a systematic molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) study in which annealing temperature, deposition cycle number, and Mo/S thickness ratio were independently varied to control the structural and electronic properties of MoS$_2$ thin films. The successful epitaxial growth of atomically uniform MoS$_2$ directly on Si substrates enables strong interfacial coupling and efficient charge transfer, offering a viable route toward semiconductor-integrated catalytic architectures. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption analyses reveal that higher annealing temperatures and excessive deposition cycles enhance crystallinity but reduce edge-site density and electrical conductivity, leading to diminished hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, intermediate cycle numbers and sulfur-deficient growth conditions yield heterostructures composed of MoS$_2$ with residual metallic Mo and sulfur vacancies, which activate otherwise inert basal planes while providing conductive pathways. These defect-engineered films deliver the best catalytic performance, achieving overpotentials as low as -0.33 V at -10 mA cm$^{-2}$, enlarged electrochemical surface area (ECSA) up to 8.0 cm$^2$, and mass-based turnover frequencies exceeding 23 mmol H$_2$ g$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, more than double those of stoichiometric counterparts. Our findings establish sulfur stoichiometry and growth kinetics as powerful levers to tune the interplay between structural order and catalytic activity in MBE-grown MoS$_2$ and point toward a broader strategy for engineering layered catalysts at the atomic scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Superconducting density of states and vortex lattice of LaRu$_2$P$_2$ observed by Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16843</link><description>arXiv:2601.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the superconducting density of states of the iron based superconductor LaRu2P2 (Tc= 4.1 K), measured using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. From the tunneling conductance, we extract a density of states which shows the opening of a s-wave single superconducting gap. The temperature dependence of the gap also follows BCS theory. Under magnetic fields, vortices present Caroli de Gennes Matricon states, although these are strongly broadened by defect scattering. From the vortex core size we obtain a superconducting coherence length of {\xi} = 50 nm, compatible with the value extracted from macroscopic Hc2 measurements. We discuss the comparison between s-wave LaRu2P2 and pnictide unconventional multiple gap and strongly correlated Fe based superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16843v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Twisted bilayer graphene from first-principles: structural and electronic properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16851</link><description>arXiv:2601.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) for a wide range of twist angles, with a focus on structural and electronic properties. By employing density functional theory (DFT) with an optimized local basis set, we simulate tBLG, obtaining fully relaxed commensurate structures for twist angles down to 0.987{\deg}. For all angles the lattice relaxation agrees well with continuum elastic models. For angles accessible to plane-wave DFT (VASP), we provide a detailed comparison with our local basis DFT (SIESTA) calculations, demonstrating excellent agreement in both the atomic and electronic structure. The dependence of the Fermi velocity and band width on the twist angle shows qualitative agreement with results from an `exact' $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ continuum model, but reveals a small twist angle offset. Additionally, we provide details of the low-energy wavefunction character, band inversion and symmetries. Our results provide an ab initio reference point for the microscopic structure and electronic properties of tBLG which will serve as the foundation for future studies incorporating many-body effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16851v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunable Edelstein effect in intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16980</link><description>arXiv:2601.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19720</link><description>arXiv:2503.19720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications dissolve under high Fe ion irradiation (100 dpa at 10^-3 dpa s^-1, 600 C). This study examined point defects and solute substitutions using atom probe tomography, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. Combined with transmission electron microscopy, results show N-vacancies and substitutional Cr exist in VN precipitates before irradiation. Monte Carlo simulations and collision cascade simulations confirm ordered vacancies at operating temperatures help mitigate irradiation damage. However, solute additions disrupt vacancy ordering and enhance irradiation-induced damage, potentially accelerating dissolution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.19720v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene with Wide Band Gap Opening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10238</link><description>arXiv:2504.10238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of two samples of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene transferred on nickel grids is herein reported. With X ray photoemission spectroscopy on the C 1s core-level, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$ distortion was observed after the hydrogenation of a more $sp^3$-like defected graphene, while a flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, graphene reached a 62$\%$ $sp^3$ saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy showed the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching for the 100$\%$ $sp^3$ sample and a significant reduction for the other one. The high loading levels of hydrogenation led to the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The C-H stretching vibrational mode was also observed, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 62$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10238v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A new angle on stacking faults: Overcoming the edge-on limit in high-resolution defect analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15510</link><description>arXiv:2506.15510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of stacking faults - whether intrinsic or extrinsic - plays a pivotal role in defect-mediated processes in crystalline materials. Yet, current electron microscopy techniques for their reliable analysis remain limited to either conventional fringe-contrast imaging of inclined faults or atomic-resolution imaging of edge-on configurations. Here, we overcome this dichotomy by introducing a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method that enables full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults, as demonstrated for various faults in fcc, $L1_2$, and sphalerite crystals. This approach eliminates a long-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis, providing comprehensive access to stacking faults on all glide planes along the widely used [001] and [110] zone axes. We demonstrate the robustness of the method in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even for overlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. The analysis of bounding dislocations, revealing the fault's formation mechanism, is also presented for inclined geometries. Simulations reveal that fault-induced de-channeling is key to contrast formation and is strongly governed by the fault's depth within the sample. Leveraging this effect, we further establish a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae - bounded by the stacking fault itself - thereby enhancing contrast for atomic-scale studies of long-range ordering, compositional fluctuations, and nanoclustering.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.15510v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunable Luminescence From a Single Free-Base Porphyrin Molecule By Controlled Access to Optically Active States</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00630</link><description>arXiv:2511.00630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy-induced luminescence (STML) provides access to optical properties of individual molecules through a cascade of relaxation processes between many-body states. Insufficient charge attachment energies quench the relaxation cascade via optically excited states, causing even intrinsically bright molecules to remain dark in STML. Here, we leverage substrate work function control and tip-induced gating of the double barrier tunnel junction to induce an energy shift of the ionic transition state of a single free-base tetrabenzoporphyrin (H2TBP) to control access to optically excited states and bright exciton emission. The experimental observations are validated by a rate equation and polaron model considering the relaxation energy of the NaCl decoupling layer upon charging of the molecule.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00630v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Finite-temperature topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link><description>arXiv:2601.12001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at finite-temperature topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the classical three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12001v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Single-crystalline Ba&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;TaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N solid-solution photocatalyst with low defect concentrations for solar-driven water splitting</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68848-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 26 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68848-9"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68848-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Photocatalytic water splitting using a single particulate photocatalyst is a cost-efficient approach for sustainable hydrogen production.

Recently, doped wurtzite-type ferroelectrics have attracted widespread attention. We use first-principles calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, and ferroelectric properties of Y-doped AlN (Al&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;N). Our results reveal that the Y-doped AlN exhibits a large spontaneous polarization comparable to that of the Sc-doped AlN, and a relatively low ferroelectric switching barrier. Furthermore, its lower material cost and wider wurtzite phase concentration range make it more practical than Sc-doped AlN. This study further reveals that the high energy barrier hindering polarization reversal originates from the covalent Al-N bonds with high bonding strength. The calculated results indicated that the ferroelectric switching barrier decreases progressively with increasing doping concentration. This is attributed to the formation of weaker chemical bonds due to the addition of the rare-earth metal element Y, making the system more ionic and thus facilitating polarization reversal. Our work expands the ferroelectric family of the wurtzite III-nitrides and provides a physical mechanism for the reduction of energy barriers through doping, which holds significant guiding value.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/042901/3378089/Effect-of-doping-on-the-ferroelectric-properties</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Ferroelectrically reversible PL-AHE in multiferroic heterostructures of rare-earth iodides</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/042903/3378088/Ferroelectrically-reversible-PL-AHE-in</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Layer-polarized anomalous Hall effect (LP-AHE), arising from the coupling between valley-contrasting Berry curvature and the layer degree of freedom, is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and spintronics.

Layer-dependent valley polarization is tunable by sliding ferroelectricity, while valley-contrasting Berry curvature is switched by altering the magnetization orientation.

Abstract: We demonstrate widefield magnetic imaging of current flow in hydrogen terminated diamond field effect transistors (FETs) through in-substrate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Hydrogen termination of the diamond surface induces a two dimensional hole gas (2DHG), while an ensemble of near surface NV centers located $ \sim 1~\mu m$ below the surface enables noninvasive magnetic imaging of current flow with micrometer scale spatial resolution. The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\sim 600-900 \mu A$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Controlling HER activity and stability of $\gamma$- and 6,6,12-Graphyne through engineered B-N doping: DFT and Reactive MD simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15424</link><description>arXiv:2601.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $\gamma$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $\gamma$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $\pi$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $\gamma$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-Principles Study of Mg-Induced Phase Stabilization in Ga$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15438</link><description>arXiv:2601.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Mg incorporation on the relative phase stability of the four primary Ga$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with the goal of rationalizing experimental observations suggesting that diffusion from MgAl$_2$O$_4$ substrates contributes to relative stabilization of the $\gamma$ phase. Mg incorporation is modeled up to 25% of Ga sites within supercells derived from fully relaxed unit cells of each polymorph. Our results show that while $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ remains the thermodynamically most stable phase, the enthalpic differences between polymorphs decrease with increasing Mg content. The inherently disordered $\gamma$ phase, with its high configurational entropy, becomes less energetically unfavorable under Mg substitution, suggesting that entropy-driven stabilization may facilitate its formation under high-temperature and/or nonequilibrium growth conditions such as those previously reported. These findings provide a thermodynamic rationale for the experimental observation of the $\gamma$ phase during epitaxial growth on MgAl$_2$O$_4$ spinel substrates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Insights into Solute Drag Effects on Grain Boundary Motion in Mg-Al and Mg-Ca Alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15699</link><description>arXiv:2601.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slip behavior of dislocations and grain boundaries critically governs recrystallization and plastic deformation in Mg alloys and can be strongly influenced by solutes. However, the quantitative effects of solute distribution on defect mobility remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically investigate how Al and Ca solutes affect the motion of dislocations, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in Mg. Within the idealized framework of random solid-solution, solute drag is dominated by elastic interactions arising from atomic size mismatch, resulting in a stronger resistance from Ca than from Al. In contrast, under the more realistic condition where solute segregation occurs, the dominant mechanism shifts to chemically driven pinning, whose effectiveness is governed by the attainable segregation density. Owing to strong Ca-Ca repulsion, Al achieves substantially higher segregation concentrations than Ca and therefore exerts much stronger pinning effects. Notably, solute-induced retardation is significantly more pronounced for HAGBs than for LAGBs, leading to amplified solute effects during the late stages of recrystallization, where grain growth is controlled primarily by HAGB migration. These results provide atomic-scale insight into experimentally observed grain refinement in Mg alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bias-triggered conductivity relaxation (BCR): a unique tool to simultaneously investigate thermodynamics, kinetics and electrostatic effects of oxygen reactions in MIEC thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15806</link><description>arXiv:2601.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed ionic electronic transfer (MIET) reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at oxide surfaces, are of paramount importance to manifold technologically highly relevant processes and fundamental understanding must be developed to improve performance and tailor highly efficient electrodes and catalysts. Understanding such complex multi-step reactions, requires the study of kinetic processes, underlying thermodynamic properties, i.e. ionic and electronic defect concentrations and electrostatic surface effects. However conventional techniques struggle to uncover the complete picture within the same sample/measurement. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing bias-triggered conductivity relaxation (BCR) as a novel tool to investigate MIET reactions on oxides. It is based on alternating out-of-plane coulometric titration/polarization and in-plane electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, providing simultaneous electronic, ionic and extraordinarily rich surface kinetics information. This innovative combination of electrical and chemical driving forces synergizes information depth, with enhanced time resolution, versatility and speed, yet it lifts the weaknesses of the individual approaches, while remaining cost-effective and surprisingly simple. Furthermore, BCR allows to disentangle overpotential induced electrostatic modifications of the surface kinetics in a unique manner. We showcase the advantages of BCR in this work by studying the ORR in model (La,Sr)FeO$_{3-{\delta}}$ thin film electrodes and reporting on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coarsening dynamics of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns: Machine learning assisted characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16006</link><description>arXiv:2601.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprint labyrinthine patterns exhibit a level of structural complexity beyond simple stripe phases, combining local stripe order with a dense network of point-like defects. Unlike symmetry-breaking phases, where coarsening proceeds via diffusive defect annihilation, or conventional stripe phases, where curvature-driven motion of extended grain boundaries dominates, the coarsening of fingerprint labyrinths is governed primarily by localized junction and terminal defects. Using the Turing-Swift-Hohenberg equation, we study the nonequilibrium relaxation of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns following a quench. To go beyond conventional Fourier-based diagnostics, we employ a template-matching convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) to identify and track junctions and terminals directly in real space, enabling a quantitative characterization of defect statistics and spatial correlations. We show that, although these point-like defects drive coarsening, their motion is strongly constrained by the surrounding stripe geometry, leading to slow, nondiffusive dynamics that are qualitatively distinct from both conventional phase ordering and stripe coarsening. Together, these results establish defect-mediated dynamics as the central organizing principle of fingerprint labyrinthine coarsening and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning-assisted approaches for complex pattern-forming systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards a Modern Theory of Chiralization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16042</link><description>arXiv:2601.16042v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry ({\epsilon}-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called {\sigma}h -qBICs in this work. When the {{\sigma}h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12444</link><description>arXiv:2508.12444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and uncover exotic universal features from a systematic investigation. In particular, we show that for generic bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians, the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding of hard-core bosonic zero modes. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by a nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with and without the aid of a controlled defect, respectively. Analytic and numerical results are given. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to observe these predictions and identify the parameter regimes for the high-fidelity braiding, paving the way for the experimental observation of our results in the near future.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12444v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Investigation of the Effect of Thermal-Induced Atomic Motion on the Conductance of Copper Thin Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05349</link><description>arXiv:2510.05349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decrease in the size of integrated circuits (IC) and metal interconnects raise resistivity due the amplification of electron scattering effects, which decreases the efficiency of chiplets. While previous studies have investigated the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over 20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions, helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs and their metal interconnects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05349v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acoustoelectric Probing of Fractal Energy Spectra in Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06313</link><description>arXiv:2512.06313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\'e superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moir\'e-engineered 2D systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06313v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Above Room Temperature Ferroelectricity in Epitaxially Strained KTaO3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14627</link><description>arXiv:2601.14627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures. The results demon- strate a robust intrinsic ferroelectric state in epitaxially strained KTaO3 thin films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14627v2</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Ferroelectric‐Polarization‐Driven Structural Engineering of Bi3Nb17O47 Anodes for High‐Performance Lithium‐Ion Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202520293?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 04:39:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202520293</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Polar discontinuities, emergent conductivity, and critical twist-angle-dependent behaviour at wafer-bonded ferroelectric interfaces</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68553-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 23 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68553-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68553-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Wafer bonding has allowed the synthesis of twisted interfaces which support polar discontinuities in ferroelectric lithium niobate.

Ferroelectric neuromorphic devices, which emulate synaptic functions, offer a promising path toward such PSC integration and toward overcoming the energy limitations of von Neumann architectures. However, incompatibility with mainstream semiconductor platforms has always hindered the practical application of traditional oxide ferroelectrics. Recently, wurtzite-structured nitride ferroelectrics have emerged as highly attractive candidates for neuromorphic devices, combining the merits of compatibility with mainstream semiconductor platforms, enhanced remanent polarization (P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and piezoelectric polarization, scalability to ultrathin thicknesses, high Curie temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), and robust ferroelectric phase stability. While prior reviews have covered basic properties, growth methods, and memristive operation mechanisms of AlScN-based devices, achieving the deep integration of physical systems with artificial intelligence demands memristors with functionalities beyond mere storage and computation. A critical future direction involves embedding multisensory capabilities into neuromorphic devices to enable truly embodied intelligence. This review focuses on the application of wurtzite ferroelectrics in embodied intelligence neuromorphic devices. Given that neuromorphic computing is tightly linked to ferroelectric domain evolution and material properties, the domain dynamics of wurtzite ferroelectrics, including reverse domain nucleation and domain wall motion mechanisms during polarization switching, are systematically discussed. Additionally, we analyze the key factors influencing ferroelectric performance and their modulation strategies, which are critical for ensuring the functionality of neuromorphic devices. For device applications, we summarize the working principles and latest progress in neuromorphic devices, with particular emphasis on two-terminal memristors based on AlScN/n-GaN heterojunction and three-terminal memristors based on two-dimensional materials or two-dimensional electron gas channels, highlighting their potential to integrate sensing, memory, and computation within a single platform.

Abstract: Thin films of colloidal semiconductor CdSe quantum-dots (QDs) and a styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer were prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and their photoluminescence was characterized by confocal fluorescence lifetime microscopy. In the films, the photoluminescence dynamics are strongly affected by excitation energy migration between close-packed quantum-dots and energy trapping by surface-defective QDs or small clusters of aggregated QDs. Polymer/QD films with more aggregated QD regions exhibit lower PL intensities and faster decays, which we attribute primarily to the increased ability of excitations to find trap sites among more close-packed QD regions. This was confirmed by comparing films from bilayer or co-spreading deposition, and varying the QD-to-polymer composition or the surface pressure at deposition. The more regular films, such as those obtained by bilayer deposition at high-pressure, display more surface emission intensity and decays with less accentuated curvature. Decay analysis was performed with a model that accounts for excitation energy migration and trapping in the films. In the framework of the model, the photoluminescence dynamics are related to film morphology through the density of energy traps. A lower amount of QD clustering in the films reflects on a lower density of energy traps and, thus, on more emissive QD films, as inferred here for bilayer films relatively to co-spreading films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14331v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Approaching Kasteleyn transition in frustrated quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14382</link><description>arXiv:2601.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Kasteleyn transition, the abrupt proliferation of infinite strings of defects in classical dimer and related models, can also be relevant for frustrated 2d quantum magnets. This is explicitly demonstrated in a phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond-decorated honeycomb lattice where a family of exact eigenstates built as products of dimer and plaquette singlets can be mapped onto the dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice. The low-temperature properties of this phase are accurately described by an effective dimer model with anisotropic activities and a small, tunable density of monomers, leading to an arbitrarily sharp crossover version of the Kasteleyn transition. The generalization to other geometries and the possibility to realize this model in organo-metallic compounds are briefly discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pressure Tuning of Electronic Correlations and Flat Bands in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14439</link><description>arXiv:2601.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly identified strongly correlated kagome superconductor, characterized by non-Fermi-liquid behavior at elevated temperatures and intertwined charge- and spin-density-wave order below $T_{DW}\approx 54$K. Under external pressure, this order is suppressed and a superconducting phase emerges. This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure. Our results further strengthen the interpretation that pressure effectively weakens electronic correlations through enhanced orbital hybridization. This, in turn, strongly suggests that superconductivity emerges as a direct consequence of the suppression of the system's ordered phase.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coupled concentration-charge dynamics in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, local transient response and fluctuations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14442</link><description>arXiv:2601.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupled dynamics of concentration and charge in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, focusing on the interplay between diffusion asymmetry and external electric fields. Using Brownian dynamics simulations and linearized stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), we analyze the transient response of charge and number currents to inhomogeneous electric fields, as well as the steady-state spatio-temporal fluctuations under uniform fields. Our results reveal that asymmetry in ionic diffusion coefficients introduces a non-trivial coupling between charge and number transport, which modifies the two relaxation modes already present in symmetric electrolytes -- a fast one associated with charge relaxation and a slow one linked to ambipolar diffusion. The dynamics are further modulated by the applied field, which enhances diffusion, alters screening lengths, and induces oscillatory behavior in the relaxation modes. The SDFT framework provides closed-form expressions for the intermediate scattering matrix, capturing the dynamics of density fluctuations and cross-correlations between number and charge. These predictions are validated by simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a wide range of wave vectors, both at equilibrium and under a finite electric field. Our findings highlight the critical role of diffusion asymmetry and external fields in tuning the transport properties of electrolytes, with implications for nanofluidic devices, energy harvesting, and iontronic circuits. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, offering a robust framework for understanding and controlling electrolyte dynamics in asymmetric systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Above Room Temperature Ferroelectricity in Epitaxially Strained KTaO3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14627</link><description>arXiv:2601.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures. The results demon- strate a robust intrinsic ferroelectric state in epitaxially strained KTaO3 thin films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14627v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Functionalization of reduced graphite oxide sheets with a zwitterionic surfactant</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14760</link><description>arXiv:2601.14760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Films of a few layers in thickness of reduced graphite oxide, RGO, sheets functionalized by the zwitterionic surfactant N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate, DDPS, are obtained by using the Langmuir-Blodgett method. The quality of the RGO sheets is checked by analyzing the degrees of reduction and defect repair by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy -AFM, field-emission scanning electron microscopy -SEM, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements. A modified Hummers method is used to obtain highly oxidized graphite oxide, GO, together with a centrifugation-based method to improve the quality of GO. The GO samples are reduced by hydrazine or vitamin C. Functionalization of RGO with the zwitterionic surfactant improves the degrees of reduction and defect repair of the two reducing agents and significantly increases the electrical conductivity of paperlike films compared with those prepared from unfunctionalized RGO.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14760v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Significance of the dispersion force for ferroelectric switching in ZnO and related materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14847</link><description>arXiv:2601.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite-ZnO is a wide-bandgap polar material with a ferroelectric-switching barrier that is too high to utilize, but the barrier can be reduced and switching observed in substituted materials such as Zn0.5Mg0.5O. Here, we seek to understand atomic-scale features that control concerted polarization switching in these and related systems, focusing on the planar hexagonal structures h-ZnO and Zn0.5Mg0.5O that may act as metastable intermediate phases along the switching pathway. Consensus is obtained by considering a range of pure and dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (DFT) computational approaches, as well as ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF), M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation-theory (MP2), and random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations. The perceived stability of h-ZnO is found to be strongly influenced by the dispersion correction, with the consensus being that dispersion interactions are insufficient to stabilize h-ZnO as a metastable phase in infinite crystals. In contrast, h-Zn0.5Mg0.5O is consistently predicted to be at least metastable, with some dispersion-corrected DFT approaches predicting it to be more stable than its wurtzite form; all DFT methods overestimate its stability compared to MP2 and RPA. Dispersion forces are found to be most significant for hypothetical planar hexagonal structures constrained to the lattice vectors of the wurtzite phases. In general, our results demonstrate that an accurate treatment of dispersion forces is essential when describing polarization switching and ferroelectric behavior in wurtzite-structured materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Role of Defects in the Paramagnetism of Fe-doped Cs$_{2}$AgBiBr$_{6}$ Double Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14885</link><description>arXiv:2601.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal doping enables the introduction of spin functionality into halide double perovskites, while simultaneously modifying optical properties. Here, we combine controlled single-crystal growth, optical characterization, comprehensive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and first-principles modeling to identify the microscopic nature of Fe-related centers in Fe-doped Cs$_{2}$AgBiBr$_{6}$. Single crystals with nominal Fe$^{3+}$ concentrations up to 15% in the precursor stage were grown using a controlled-cooling method, yielding reproducible Fe incorporation up to 0.1% w.r.t. Bi, without secondary phases. Despite this low concentration, Fe doping introduces electronic states that influence optical absorption and photoluminescence. EPR measurements reveal an S = 5/2 Fe$^{3+}$-related center whose anisotropy follows the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition below 120 K. Angular-dependent EPR resolves two configurations of this nearly axial spin center, with principal axes rotated by 90$^\circ$ and aligned with the $a/b$ plane of the tetragonal lattice. Density-functional calculations attribute these centers to impurity-vacancy complexes, most likely Fe$_{\rm Bi}$-V$_{\rm Br}$, that stabilise in a basal configuration of the low-temperature phase. This approach resolves vacancy-coupled defect orientations, narrowing possible models to Fe$^{3+}$-vacancy complexes and establishing them as stable, orientation-sensitive spin probes of structural symmetry in halide double perovskites, while providing a microscopic basis for tuning their magnetic and optical responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14885v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modeling the Thermal Behavior of Photopolymers for In-Space Fabrication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14897</link><description>arXiv:2601.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future long-duration space missions will require in-situ, on-demand manufacturing of tools and components. Photopolymer-based processes are attractive for this purpose due to their low energy requirements, volume efficiency, and precise control of curing. However, photopolymerization generates significant heat, which is difficult to regulate in microgravity where natural convection is absent, leading to defects such as surface blistering and deformation. In this work, we combine experimental studies and modeling to address these thermal challenges. We report results from International Space Station (ISS) experiments and a dedicated parabolic flight campaign, which confirm that suppressed convective heat transfer in microgravity exacerbates thermal buildup and defect formation. Building on these observations, we present a predictive thermal model that couples heat transfer, light absorption, and evolving material properties to simulate polymerization and temperature evolution under terrestrial and microgravity conditions. Laboratory validation demonstrates strong agreement between model predictions and measured temperature profiles. Applying the model to the ISS experiments, we show that the model accurately reproduces experimentally observed blistering in TJ-3704A, a commercial acrylate-based polymer resin, while also predicting defect-free outcomes for Norland optical adhesives. The model functions as a design tool for defect-free in-space manufacturing, enabling selection of polymer properties, exposure strategies, and environmental conditions that together inhibit excess thermal buildup, paving the way for scalable, reliable in-situ manufacturing during future missions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Precisely positioned generation of CsPbBr3 nano-light sources in a Cs4PbBr6 film by electron beam irradiation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14898</link><description>arXiv:2601.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of high-quality photon emitters at specific locations within nanophotonic structures or optoelectronic devices is a key to innovating on-chip optical control and quantum technologies. Halide perovskite nanoparticles have great potential as single photon emitters with high quantum efficiency. To achieve their full potential, they must be embedded in a host material that ensures chemical stability and passivates surface defects. A previous experiment on a CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposite film suggested possibility that electron beam irradiation can be used to control positions of CsPbBr3 nano-light sources in the Cs4PbBr6 host although the effects of electron beam irradiation are not fully understood. Here, we fabricate a Cs4PbBr6-CsBr film, not containing the CsPbBr3 phase, and provide direct evidence that CsPbBr3 nanoparticles can be locally generated in the Cs4PbBr6 host by irradiation with a focused electron beam. We further demonstrate perovskite nano-light source arrays with submicron spacing using this method.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14898v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pristine and Doped MoS2 Monolayers as Potential HCN Gas Sensors: A DFT Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14972</link><description>arXiv:2601.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been extensively investigated due to their tunable properties. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate the adsorption behavior and sensing characteristics of HCN on pristine and doped MoS2 monolayers (X-MoS2, where X = P, N, Si, Al, B, Cl). The structural, electronic, and optical characteristics of all systems are examined to study the sensing properties of various doped MoS2 monolayers. In particular, the Al-MoS2 system demonstrates the strongest adsorption characterized by chemisorption, while the remaining systems show interactions of physisorption type. Recovery time and changes in electronic and optical properties reveal that Si-MoS2 possesses an ultrafast response of the order of microseconds, while Al-MoS2 exhibits a significantly longer recovery time, making it unsuitable for reusable sensors. P-MoS2, Si-MoS2, and Al-MoS2 monolayers show pronounced changes in their properties after HCN adsorption. To explore tunability in adsorption strength and recovery behavior, systems with two and three dopant atoms are further studied for P, Si, and Al doping. The results indicate that double doping enhances adsorption strength, whereas triple symmetric doping weakens it. Based on adsorption energy, recovery time, and electronic response, 2P-MoS2 and 3Al-MoS2 are identified as promising candidates for electrochemical and chemiresistive sensing of HCN. Additionally, the observed optical response in the ultraviolet region highlights their potential in UV-range optical sensor design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14972v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Evolution of Vortex Strings after a Thermal Quench in a Holographic Superfluid</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14328</link><description>arXiv:2601.14328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous phase transitions exhibits nonequilibrium universality. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts universal scaling of point-like defect numbers under slow driving, the statistical properties of extended defects remain largely unexplored across both slow and fast protocols. We investigate vortex string formation in a three-dimensional holographic superfluid. For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature. Beyond the vortex string number, the loop-length distribution reveals a richer structure: individual loops follow the first-return statistics of three-dimensional random walks, $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-5/2}$. While the total vortex length distribution remains Gaussian, its cumulants obey universal scaling laws with varying power-law exponents, and thus differ markedly from those observed in point-defect systems, indicating distinct statistical features of extended topological defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect-modified acoustic phonons in a single layer of MoS2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14464</link><description>arXiv:2503.14464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal, mechanical, and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is governed by their low-energy phonons, yet the impact of atomic-scale disorder on these modes remains poorly understood. Here, we report the first measurement of acoustic phonon dispersions in a quasi-freestanding monolayer semiconductor (MoS2), using helium-3 spin-echo spectroscopy. We identify a defect-driven regime change at a critical wavevector, $q_c$, marking the breakdown of continuum elastic behavior. At this length scale, the flexural mode transitions from continuum bending to defect-pinned standing waves, while the hybridized Rayleigh wave becomes vibrationally disordered in its dispersion and linewidth. We observe multiple defect-induced Van Hove singularities deep within the Brillouin zone and strongly suppressed acoustic group velocities, providing direct experimental evidence that four-phonon processes drive thermal transport in mono- and few-layer MoS2. These results offer a microscopic explanation for the anomalously low thermal conductivity widely observed in transition-metal dichalcogenides and demonstrate how atomic-scale disorder dictates energy flow in two-dimensional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14464v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Devil's staircase in a constrained kagome Ising antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05889</link><description>arXiv:2505.05889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the constrained Ising model on the kagome lattice with infinite first and third neighbor couplings undergoes an infinite series of thermal first-order transitions at which, as in the Kasteleyn transition, linear defects of infinite length condense. However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.05889v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linked skyrmions in shifted magnetic bilayer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01491</link><description>arXiv:2506.01491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic solitons have recently attracted significant attention due to their intricate physical properties and potential applications in information processing. The majority of the studies in this field, however, are focused on a particular type of solitons known as skyrmions, characterised by a unit topological charge. Here, we present a shifted magnetic bilayer that can demonstrate magnetic solitons with arbitrary large topological charges. These configurations, which we call linked skyrmions, consist of multiple skyrmions linked together with topological point defects. These topological point defects, termed as anti-aligned points, originate from the mutually orthogonal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in two different layers. By tuning the interlayer exchange coupling and the external magnetic field, one can also achieve different ground states in this bilayer. Additionally, the system also demonstrates conventional skyrmion-bags and $k\pi$-skyrmions. Finally we propose a suitable material candidate where these magnetic configurations can be realised. Our findings, thus, can provide a way to achieve solitons with large topological charge and realise them in realistic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01491v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Significant surface-mediated reduction of radiation damage in tungsten revealed by advanced ion channeling analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15132</link><description>arXiv:2512.15132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tungsten is a leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15132v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121</link><description>arXiv:2601.13121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13121v2</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Effect of metal ion coordination bond on the thermal conductivity of cellulose nanofibrils</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/3/031904/3377874/Effect-of-metal-ion-coordination-bond-on-the</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;To address the diversified thermal management requirements of flexible electronic devices, there is an urgent need to develop flexible materials that combine excellent mechanical properties with on-demand tunable thermal conductivity, thereby enabling efficient thermal design and structural–functional integration. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are an eco-friendly, high-strength material with tunable thermal conductivity, showing considerable potential. To better harness this potential, a deeper understanding of how different bonding forms affect their intrinsic thermal conduction and the underlying regulatory mechanisms is required. To this end, this study employs a self-designed flow-focusing assembly system to systematically investigate the regulatory effects of synergistic bonding networks on the thermal conductivity of materials by controlling the concentration of multivalent metal ions that induce CNF gelation. This approach enables continuous adjustment of the thermal conductivity of CNF films within the range of 0.241–0.758 W m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Raman spectroscopy and micro-Fourier transform infrared analyses indicate that the role of multivalent metal ions primarily stems from a triple mechanism: the reduction of crystallinity, which shortens phonon mean free paths; the competitive reconstruction of bonding networks, where moderate ion addition strengthens hydrogen bonding, while higher concentrations promote coordination-dominated regimes; and the introduction of structural heterogeneities—such as phase boundaries in Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced gels and point defects in Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-crosslinked networks—that intensify phonon scattering and collectively govern thermal transport. This study reveals the structure–property relationship between ion-mediated microstructural evolution and thermal transport in CNFs, providing insights for the design of high-performance CNF materials for intelligent thermal management applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/3/031904/3377874/Effect-of-metal-ion-coordination-bond-on-the</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] AlScN ferroelectric modulates quantum transport in AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/3/032104/3377873/AlScN-ferroelectric-modulates-quantum-transport-in</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;GaN-based heterojunction two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) plays a significant role in high-speed microelectronics, high-efficiency photodetectors, and spintronic devices. The integration of wurtzite ferroelectrics with GaN-based heterojunctions offers a promising route for non-volatile control of 2DEG transport properties. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on room-temperature operation and carrier density modulation, while the low-temperature quantum transport properties under ferroelectric gating and their regulation mechanism remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that an AlScN ferroelectric gate can effectively and reversibly modulate both the carrier density and quantum coherence of the 2DEG in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures. Through systematic magnetotransport measurements, a significant enhancement of weak localization (WL) under upward ferroelectric polarization was observed, accompanied by a drastic reduction in electron mobility. By analyzing the confinement degree of the 2DEG, we reveal that the ferroelectric polarization not only depletes carriers but also strongly enhances interface scattering by tightening the quantum confinement, thereby amplifying the WL effect and reducing the mobility. Our findings provide insights into the role of ferroelectric polarization in modulating quantum transport and highlight the potential of AlScN for non-volatile, low-power cryogenic memory, and quantum devices.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/3/032104/3377873/AlScN-ferroelectric-modulates-quantum-transport-in</guid></item><item><title>[APL Materials Current Issue] Improving charge carrier lifetime and mobility in hyperdoped silicon by seed quality engineering</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/1/011112/3377807/Improving-charge-carrier-lifetime-and-mobility-in</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The performance of hyperdoped silicon-based solar cells and photodetectors synthesized via ion implantation and pulsed laser melting can be enhanced by improving the fabrication process. Considering silicon self-implant as a model system, we show that there are two ways to reduce ion implantation defects and improve material quality: (1) increasing the pulsed laser melting depth and (2) introducing a pre-annealing step. This leads to improved charge carrier lifetimes and mobilities. We apply the pre-annealing method to tellurium- and gold-hyperdoped silicon samples and test the charge-carrier dynamics at two excitation wavelengths. After pre-annealing, for silicon self-implanted samples and tellurium-hyperdoped silicon samples, the carrier lifetime improves beyond our experimental detection limit (&amp;gt;4 ns) and a limited lifetime improvement is observed in gold-hyperdoped silicon. The improvement of mobility in silicon self-implanted sample is 1.3 times higher, two times higher in tellurium-hyperdoped silicon, and 1.1 times higher in gold-hyperdoped silicon after 350 °C pre-annealing. The improvement in carrier lifetime and mobility in Si:Te follows our model system, but the limited improvement in Si:Au suggests that dopant–defect interactions might limit the benefits of pre-annealing. Our study also shows that incorporating one additional step in the fabrication process can enhance carrier transport in hyperdoped-silicon-based solar cells and photodetectors.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) flakes of ReSe2 structure were grown by chemical vapor deposition and investigated at room temperature using Raman, photoluminescence, and absorption spectroscopies. The Raman spectra revealed eighteen phonon modes in the range of 100-300 cm-1 that were found in good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The ReSe2 crystal structure and morphology were investigated using XRD, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The energy dispersion spectroscopy confirmed the 1:2 elemental composition. The absorption spectra were obtained for ReSe2 flakes and found to exhibit excitonic peaks in the spectral region of 885 - 942 nm. These peaks are used to define the band gap of the material. The DFT calculations predicted an indirect bandgap of 0.88 eV for the bulk structure, while a direct bandgap of 1.26 eV was predicted for the monolayer.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11726v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Self-organized defect-phases along dislocations in irradiated alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11843</link><description>arXiv:2601.11843v1 Announce Type: new

The stabilization of nano-necklaces is rationalized by heavy-tail power-law distributions for solute redistribution along the dislocation due to advection.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11843v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton-polaron Umklapp scattering in Wigner crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11914</link><description>arXiv:2601.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link><description>arXiv:2601.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Intrinsic ductility enhancement in Mg alloys elucidated via large-scale ab-initio calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12202</link><description>arXiv:2601.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium is the lightest structural alloy, yet its practical use is limited by its low ductility. Recent studies suggest ductility enhancement in dilute Mg alloys may stem from favorable solute modification of  pyramidal I/II screw dislocation core energy difference, activating  slip via a double cross-slip mechanism. This work conducts large-scale DFT calculations, reaching ~6,000 atoms, of  dislocation energetics in Mg and Mg-Y/Zn alloys. We find that relative solute strengthening effects on pyramidal I and II screw dislocation glide are crucial for cross-slip enhancement in Mg-Y, in contrast to prior investigations, that find solute-mediated dislocation-core energy modification as the main driver. Our predictions align with single- and poly-crystal experimental results and also capture the transition from pyramidal II to I preferred slip in Mg-Y.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sub-domain structure in a single crystal of the magnetic topological insulator MnSb2Te4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12399</link><description>arXiv:2601.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domain structure of a MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ single crystal with a Curie temperature $T_C \approx 45~K$ was studied using the high-resolution Bitter decoration technique.

These results indicate the existence of two magnetically weakly coupled subsystems -- surface and bulk.

Abstract: The cross-unitcell long displacements in some recent emergent ferroelectrics have actually challenged the classical definition of ferroelectricity, while the relative explorations are still in the early stage and even controversial. In this paper we provide a general model that gives the picture for the evolution and transition from typical ferroelectricity to long displacement ferroelectricity, which is classified into type-I and type-II. In particular, type-I with two switching modes of different barriers may switch between conventional ferroelectricity and ion-conduction-like ferroelectricity depending on various factors including electric field, boundaries, vacancies, temperature, etc.., which is demonstrated by first-principles calculations on {\gamma}-AlOOH and CuInP2S6 as two paradigmatic cases. Intriguingly, their polarizations are nonlocal since the boundaries also determine the switching mode and polarization direction, which can be different for the same given crystal structure. Such type-I can be evolved from conventional ferroelectricity as the migration barrier across unitcell is reduced, and will behave like type-II at elevated temperature as the conventional part becomes paraelectric. These unconventional behaviors can be applicable to various systems, and many previously unclarified phenomena can be well explained.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] INTERFACE Force Field for Alumina with Validated Bulk Phases and a pH-Resolved Surface Model Database for Electrolyte and Organic Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12570</link><description>arXiv:2601.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alumina and aluminum oxyhydroxides underpin chemical-engineering technologies from heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion protection, functional coatings, energy-storage devices, to biomedical components. Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. The results establish a predictive computational platform to design alumina-containing functional materials under realistic process conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Successful growth of low carrier density $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using Se-flux in a modified Bridgman furnace</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12588</link><description>arXiv:2601.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide (In$_2$Se$_3$) has garnered significant attention for its intriguing properties and applications in batteries, solar cells, photodetectors and ferroelectric devices. However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is essential because leakage current can obscure polarization switching. Here, we report the growth of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using a unique approach, the Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique combined with liquid encapsulation under high pressure. This approach creates a high-pressure, Se-rich environment that effectively minimizes Se-vaporization. Structural and compositional analysis using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the formation of pure $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with 3R stacking. Furthermore, the crystals exhibit remarkably low carrier density of 1.5-3.2 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at 300K$-$the lowest reported to date, reflecting a significant suppression of Se-vacancies relative to the conventional Bridgman or melt-grown crystals. Through transport and ARPES measurements on different batches of crystals, we also demonstrate that the amount of Se-flux plays a crucial role in controlling Se-vacancies. Our results thus establish this modified Bridgman method as an effective strategy for synthesizing large $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with reduced intrinsic defects. This technique can be broadly applied to grow other volatile chalcogenides with reduced defects and controlled stoichiometry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Self-Consistent Coulomb Interactions from Embedded Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12678</link><description>arXiv:2601.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent first-principles framework for determining the screened Coulomb interaction strength (U) based on constrained dynamical mean-field theory (cDMFT). Unlike conventional approaches, this method incorporates essential vertex corrections within the same embedded-DMFT formalism used for the electronic structure calculation. Using the cDMFT-derived interaction strengths as input to embedded DMFT yields spectral functions in excellent agreement with photoemission experiments across a wide range of materials, spanning 3d to 5d transition-metal compounds, including correlated metals, Mott insulators, altermagnets, and unconventional superconductors. This unified many-body framework establishes a systematic first-principles route for determining interaction strengths in correlated materials and substantially enhances the predictive power of DFT+DMFT and its extensions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12678v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum theory of elastic strings and the thermal conductivity of glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12721</link><description>arXiv:2601.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal conductivity of amorphous solids by constructing a continuum model whose degrees of freedom are propagating vibrational modes (phonons) and extended Volterra dislocation line defects with their own vibrational degrees of freedom which do not propagate in space. Our working assumption is that these additional degrees of freedom account for the "boson peak" that is observed in glassy materials. This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material. We obtain a satisfactory description of thermal conductivity data with both approaches. We conclude by discussing prospects to test the predictive power of this model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lithium and sodium decorated PHE-graphene for high capacity hydrogen storage: A DFT and GCMC study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12722</link><description>arXiv:2601.12722v1 Announce Type: new

Additionally, through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, we obtained the hydrogen weight ratios and adsorption enthalpy curves for Li- and Na-modified PHE under varying temperature and pressure conditions. These findings indicate that both Li- and Na-modified PHE-graphene are exceptional candidates for hydrogen storage materials, particularly in mobile applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum droplets in a resonant Bose-Fermi mixture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12777</link><description>arXiv:2601.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the canonical problem of a Fermi gas interacting with a weakly repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. To explore the quantum phases across the full range of boson-fermion interactions, we construct a versatile variational ansatz that incorporates pair correlations and correctly captures the different polaron limits. Remarkably, we find that self-bound quantum droplets can exist in the strongly interacting regime, preempting the formation of boson-fermion dimers, when the Fermi pressure is balanced by the resonant boson-fermion attraction. This scenario can be achieved in experimentally available Bose-Fermi mixtures for a range of boson-fermion mass ratios in the vicinity of equal masses. We furthermore show that a larger fermion density instead yields phase separation between a Bose-Fermi mixture and excess fermions, as well as behavior reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point. Our results suggest that first-order quantum phase transitions play a crucial role in the phase diagram of Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovery of Ferroelectric Twin Boundaries in a Photoactive Halide Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12892</link><description>arXiv:2601.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for next-generation photovoltaics, laser sources and X-ray detectors. There is intense debate as to whether some photoactive halide perovskites exhibit ferroelectric behaviour and whether it might be possible to utilise the bulk photovoltaic effect to enhance the performance of halide perovskite solar cells. Here, using low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy, we discover the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited CsPbI3 thin films, parallel to {110} and {112}. Remarkably, despite photoactive CsPbI3 being centrosymmetric and non-polar, we observe directly that Pb atoms shift at {110} twin boundaries driving a local ferroelectric-like polarisation. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, spaced ~30-50 nm apart, embedded within the non-polar perovskite lattice. In contrast, {112} twin boundaries remain non-polar but strongly suppress octahedral tilt and off-centre Cs atom displacements, revealing a different untapped ferroic degree of freedom. These discoveries together uncover previously hidden ferroic functionality in halide perovskite semiconductors, opening opportunities for enhanced conductivity and photovoltaic behaviour through domain wall engineering.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12892v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall formation in tetragonal phase BaTiO3 via machine learning potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12914</link><description>arXiv:2601.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 exhibit spontaneous polarization that can be reoriented by an external electric field, forming the basis of various memory, actuator, and sensor applications. The polarization switching behavior, however, is strongly influenced by mechanical boundary conditions due to the intrinsic electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics. In this study, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential to investigate the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall evolution in the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3. This study revealed a critical stress about 120 MPa which 90 degree polarization switching occurs. Beyond the critical stress, larger supercells exhibit lower activation energies for polarization switching with 180-degree domain wall formation and weaker constraints from periodic boundary conditions, thereby facilitating domain-wall formation. Besides, Increasing compressive stress reduces both the remnant polarization and the coercive field, while a double hysteresis loop emerges at a stress level of 80 MPa. These findings provide atomistic insights into stress-controlled ferroelectric switching and highlight the crucial role of mechanical loading in designing reliable ferroelectric devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Water Phase Diagram from a General-Purpose Atomic Cluster Expansion Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12947</link><description>arXiv:2601.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water's phase diagram remains one of the most intricate and challenging benchmarks in molecular modeling. In this study, we compute the phase diagram of water using an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential trained on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the revPBE-D3 exchange and correlation functional. We compute solid-liquid chemical potential differences and melting points using biased coexistence simulations with the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method. Starting from these points, we trace coexistence lines using Gibbs-Duhem integration. This combination of methods allows us to consistently map pressure-temperature phase boundaries and reconstruct the full phase diagram between approximately 100-500 K and 0-4 GPa. The stability regions of the main ice polymorphs (Ih, II, V, VI, and VII) are reproduced in close agreement with experiments. As in earlier studies based on DFT, ice III is metastable and there are systematic shifts of coexistence lines with respect to experimental results. Our results demonstrate the capability of our general-purpose ACE potential to capture the complex phase behavior of water across wide thermodynamic conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12947v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121</link><description>arXiv:2601.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13125</link><description>arXiv:2601.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13125v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Guided Polymorph Selection in Molecular Beam Epitaxy of In2Se3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13156</link><description>arXiv:2601.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide (In2Se3), a layered chalcogenide with multiple polymorphs, is a promising material for optoelectronic and ferroelectric applications. However, achieving polymorph-pure thin films remains a major challenge due to the complex growth space. In this work, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is successfully leveraged to guide the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of In2Se3 on Al2O3 substrates. By training a predictive Gaussian Process Regressor with sequential learning, we efficiently explored substrate temperature, indium flux, selenium flux, and cracker temperature, reducing experimental trials required for successful synthesis. A {\gamma}-In2Se3 film with 91% phase purity was achieved after fewer than ten trials. Attempts to isolate {\alpha}-In2Se3 were limited by amorphous film formation at low temperatures, indicating that single-step co-deposition is unsuitable for crystalline {\alpha}-In2Se3 on Al2O3. Overall, this study validates Bayesian Optimization as a powerful approach for phase-selective growth in complex materials systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13283</link><description>arXiv:2601.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-broken superconducting configurations from density functional theory for bcc and hcp metals and Nb3Sn</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13292</link><description>arXiv:2601.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently proposed a unified theoretical framework for superconductivity that broadens the applicability of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory to both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Within this framework, superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) generated by atomic perturbations of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). The SCC emerges through electron-phonon interaction and gives rise to distinct straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) in the charge density difference of electrons and/or holes. These SODTs originate from regular and systematic atomic displacements between the SCC and NCC, a phenomenon revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To further verify this framework, we performed DFT-based calculations for 12 hexagonal close-packed (hcp) elements (Be, Mg, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Tc, Re, Ru, Os, and Zn), 5 body-centered cubic (bcc) elements (V, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W), and the compound Nb3Sn. Our results indicate that all these materials exhibit superconductivity at 0 K and 0 GPa, as evidenced by the predicted SODTs. Notably, Mg, Sc, and Y are predicted to be superconducting under ambient pressure, a finding that awaits experimental confirmation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13292v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights into $CO_{2}$ activation on defective ZnS surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13434</link><description>arXiv:2601.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate $CO_{2}$ activation on ZnS using Near Ambient-Pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (NAP-XPS) and density functional theory calculations (DFT). Our NAP-XPS experiments reveal that $CO_{2}$ adsorbs onto a defective ZnS surface upon heating above $473 \ K$ in a $CO_{2}$ atmosphere (up to $0.55 \ mbar$). The $CO_{2}$ adsorption fingerprint is detectable even after cooling to room temperature under ultra-high vacuum. Our DFT calculations suggest that $CO_{2}$ adsorption is energetically favorable on ZnS surfaces containing zinc vacancies, highlighting defect sites as key adsorption centers. Additionally, oxygen adsorption on a defective ZnS surface is exothermic, in contrast to the endothermic behavior observed on a defect-free surface. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of defect-driven surface reactivity and may inform ZnS-based catalyst's design for $CO_{2}$ capture and reutilization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13434v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CatMaster: An Agentic Autonomous System for Computational Heterogeneous Catalysis Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13508</link><description>arXiv:2601.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend.
  Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Epitaxial Al/InGaAs system: Solid-state dewetting and Al facet formation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13523</link><description>arXiv:2601.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor--semiconductor platforms can host subgap electronic excitations such as Andreev bound states (ABSs); in topological regimes, a special zero-energy class, Majorana bound states (MBSs), can emerge. Here we report the growth of epitaxial Al films by molecular-beam epitaxy on $\mathrm{In_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}As}$ under near-room-temperature substrate conditions. Using a combination of AFM/SEM, cross-sectional TEM, and \emph{in situ} RHEED, we map how substrate temperature and Al deposition rate govern film morphology, continuity, and interface quality. We identify a growth window that yields continuous, superconducting Al films with an abrupt $\mathrm{Al}/\mathrm{In_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}As}$ interface and no detectable indium interdiffusion. We further investigate the thermal stability of these films under \emph{in situ} post-growth heating and \emph{ex situ} annealing following surface oxidation. For unoxidized Al, rapid surface diffusion triggers solid-state dewetting at approximately $165\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, resulting in the formation of $\{111\}$-faceted Al islands. In contrast, the presence of a native oxide largely suppresses dewetting, with failure occurring only locally at surface defects. Annealing above the indium melting point ($156.6\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$) induces significant In surface migration in both cases, leading either to localized interfacial In inclusions beneath Al agglomerates or to uniform surface contamination at sites of localized layer breakdown. Together, these results define growth and annealing conditions for thermally robust epitaxial Al on III--V semiconductors and provide practical guidance for fabricating high-quality superconductor--semiconductor hybrid platforms for quantum devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13523v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Layer Decoupling in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$ Uncovered by Automated Dark-Field Tomography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13620</link><description>arXiv:2601.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer systems host a wealth of emergent phenomena, such as flat-band superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and ferroelectricity, arising from moir\'e superlattices and unconventional interlayer coupling. Despite their central role, direct and quantitative access to the out-of-plane atomic structure in these systems has remained elusive due to their nanoscale dimensions. Here, we introduce an automated dark-field electron tomography technique that enables three-dimensional structural analysis of atomically thin materials with sub-angstrom precision. Applying this method to twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we uncover a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing compared to the bulk configuration, exceeding 0.1 angstrom, along with a remarkable temperature-driven interlayer decoupling unique to the twisted bilayer. Ultrafast measurement further reveals optically induced interlayer separation of ~0.2 angstrom on the picosecond timescale, attributed to transient exciton formation. These findings not only establish a powerful approach for visualizing hidden out-of-plane structures in atomically thin micro-flake materials, but also uncover the intrinsic fragility and dynamical tunability of interlayer coupling in moir\'e-engineered 2-dimensional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] When electrons meet ferroelastic domain walls in Strontium Titanate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13654</link><description>arXiv:2601.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. M\"uller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Near-atomic investigation on the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nano-sized kappa phase and B2 phase in an Al-alloyed lightweight steel</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13721</link><description>arXiv:2601.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, correlative transmission Kikuchi diffraction transmission electron microscopy (TKD-TEM) measurements, atom probe tomography (APT), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to reveal the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nanosized kappa and B2 phases in an FCC matrix of an Al alloyed Fe-10Al-7Mn-6Ni-1C (wt.%) steel. Upon ageing at 800 C for 15 min, two co-nanoprecipitation modes are observed: B2 forming together with kappa and B2 forming separately from kappa in the FCC matrix. APT reveals that the B2 precipitate next to kappa (referred to as B2I) is close to an FeAl type phase, while the isolated B2 precipitate (referred to as B2II) is close to a NiAl type phase. The kappa precipitates maintain a nearly constant Al content of approximately 18.4 at.% regardless of their precipitation position. DFT confirms that kappa may accommodate limited Ni substitution at Fe sites without losing structural stability, and that Fe Ni atomic exchange between kappa and B2 is thermodynamically favorable at 800 C. This exchange drives the B2 phase to evolve from a NiAl type towards an FeAl type, improving the stability of both phases during co-precipitation. These results provide understanding of kappa B2 interactions and offer insights for designing nanosized intermetallic strengthened microstructures in Al alloyed lightweight steels.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Ru content on electrocatalytic activity and defect formation of Au-Pd-Pt-Ru compositionally complex solid solution thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13803</link><description>arXiv:2601.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionally complex solid solutions (CCSSs) consist of a randomly mixed single phase with the potential to enhance electrocatalytic activity through their polyelemental surface atom arrangements. However, microstructural complexity originating from multiple principal elements influences local structure, chemistry, and lattice strain, which might also affect electrocatalytic activity. Here, we investigate the effect of Ru content on electrochemistry and defect formation in Au-Pd-Pt-Ru CCSS thin films. Such defects could provide active sites when terminating at the CCSS surface or modify surface composition through preferential segregation. A thin-film material library covering a wide composition range was fabricated by room-temperature combinatorial co-sputtering. High-throughput compositional, structural and functional characterization, including electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical screening, were used to correlate composition and microstructural features with catalytic activity. Three representative compositions selected from the library - Au68Pd13Pt15Ru4, Au27Pd24Pt23Ru26, and Au9Pd21Pt18Ru52 - were examined in detail. The three samples exhibit face-centered cubic structures, with lattice contraction occurring with increasing Ru content. In addition, with increasing Ru content, a transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults was observed. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution reaction activity improves with higher Ru content. Atom probe tomography reveals local compositional fluctuations, including element-specific enrichment and depletion at grain boundaries. The findings provide a new insight into surface atom arrangement design in the CCSS electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Multiband Microscopy: A Universal Paradigm for Quantitative Nanoscale Metrology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13960</link><description>arXiv:2601.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is the primary tool for exploring nanoscale functionality, yet standard single-frequency operation is fundamentally limited, because the dynamic tip-sample interaction is mathematically underdetermined. While advanced methods such as Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) and Band Excitation (BE) address this by tracking resonance, they face critical limitations: DART suffers from feedback instability on complex topographies, while Band Excitation is constrained by severe trade-offs between spectral resolution and acquisition speed. Here, we introduce Dynamic Multiband Microscopy (DMM), a general framework that bridges these gaps by combining multifrequency excitation with continuous frequency sweeping. We implement this within an automated experimental workflow that autonomously identifies and targets measurement points of interest. In combination with quantitative interferometric detection, this approach brings SPM to the fundamental limits of noise and spectral sensitivity. Validated on ferroelectric nanofibers, this platform enables simultaneous, crosstalk-free 3D polarization mapping, establishing a universal framework for autonomous, high-fidelity nanoscale metrology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13960v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlated domain and crystallographic orientation mapping in uniaxial ferroelectric polycrystals by interferometric vector piezoresponse force microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13982</link><description>arXiv:2601.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing advances in scanning probe microscopy techniques are continually expanding the possibilities for nanoscale characterization and correlated studies of functional materials. Here, we demonstrate how a recent extension of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), known as interferometric vector PFM, can be utilized for simultaneously mapping the local crystallographic orientations and the domain structure of distributed grains in uniaxial ferroelectric polycrystals. By shifting the laser beam position on the cantilever, direction-dependent piezoresponse signals are acquired analogous to classical vector PFM, but without the need to rotate the sample. Using polycrystalline ErMnO$_{3}$ as a model system, we demonstrate that the reconstructed piezoresponse vectors correlate one-to-one with the crystallographic orientations of the micrometer-sized grains, carrying grain-orientation and domain-related information. We establish a versatile approach for rapid, multimodal characterization of polycrystalline uniaxial ferroelectrics, enabling automated, high-throughput reconstruction of polarization and grain orientations with nanoscale precision.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Faster grain-boundary diffusion with a higher activation enthalpy than bulk diffusion in ionic space-charge layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14181</link><description>arXiv:2601.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster diffusion of cations along grain boundaries is reported in the literature for a variety of acceptor-doped $AB\mathrm{O}_{3}$ perovskite-type oxides. The ratio $r$ of the activation enthalpy of grain-boundary diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{gb}$) to the activation enthalpy of bulk diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{b}$) is seen experimentally to lie in the range $0.7 &lt; r = \Delta H^\mathrm{gb} / \Delta H^\mathrm{b} &lt; 1.3$, albeit with substantial errors. In a previous publication [Parras and De Souza, Acta Mater. 195 (2020) 383] it was shown through a set of continuum simulations that cation-vacancy accumulation within negative space-charge layers at grain boundaries in acceptor-doped perovskites will give rise to faster grain-boundary diffusion of cations, with the associated values of $r$ approaching but not exceeding unity. In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r &gt; 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers. The conditions under which $r &gt; 1$ is observed are described, and issues with experimental confirmation are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizing van der Waals NbOI2 by SiO2 encapsulation for Photonic Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12470</link><description>arXiv:2601.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium oxide diiodide (NbOI2) is an emerging material for photonics and electronics, distinguished by its exceptional second-order nonlinearity and pronounced in-plane ferroelectricity, both originating from its highly anisotropic ABC-stacked crystal structure. Its broken inversion symmetry enables its optical nonlinear efficiency to scale with thickness, making multilayer NbOI2 highly promising for nonlinear frequency conversion like second harmonic generation or and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in bulk or waveguides. However, under ambient conditions NbOI2 degrades into an amorphous oxide within weeks, severely diminishing its nonlinear response. To overcome this, we investigate SiO2 encapsulation via physical vapor deposition to protect NbOI2 multilayers from environmental degradation. Our systematic study reveals that encapsulation preserves structural integrity and nonlinear optical performance, establishing NbOI2 as a stable candidate for heterogeneous integration in foundry-compatible photonic platforms and quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12470v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation Entropy: Temperature and Density Dependence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12956</link><description>arXiv:2601.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser hardening of metals occurs under the influence of a shock wave, which changes the distribution and density of one-dimensional defects - dislocations. There is a relationship between the density of dislocations, the grain size and the resistance of a single crystal to shear loading. The mechanism of hardening processes continues to be intensively studied, and the dynamics of defects plays a central role here. In this paper, the dislocation entropy is analyzed from a combinatorial point of view and from the point of view of a physical oscillator with a given energy reserve. Both contributions play an important role in describing the free energy of a one-dimensional ensemble of dislocations, and are necessary to take into account the dynamic processes inside the grain of a polycrystalline structure.

Abstract: Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \ce{Ti}, \ce{Zr}, and \ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Imaging the transition from diffusive to Landauer resistivity dipoles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15817</link><description>arXiv:2412.15817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A point-like defect in a uniform current-carrying conductor induces a dipole in the electrochemical potential, which counteracts the original transport field. If the mean free path of the carriers is much smaller than the size of the defect, the dipole results from the purely diffusive motion of the carriers around the defect. In the opposite limit, ballistic carriers scatter from the defect$-$for this situation, Rolf Landauer postulated the emergence of residual resistivity dipoles that are independent of the defect size and thus impose a fundamental limit on the resistance of the parent conductor. Here, we study resistivity dipoles around holes of different sizes in two-dimensional Bi films on Si(111). Using scanning tunneling potentiometry to image the dipoles, we find a crossover from linear to constant scaling behavior of their amplitudes with defect size, manifesting the transition from diffusive to Landauer dipoles. The extracted parameters of the transition allow us to estimate the Fermi wave vector and the carrier mean free path in our Bi films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.15817v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945</link><description>arXiv:2503.07945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This research advances the exploration of quantum phases driven by strong correlations and the design of materials for next-generation quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.07945v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04885</link><description>arXiv:2506.04885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. These quasiparticles are speculated to be the origin of chirality-induced spin selectivity and presumably can display exotic dynamic behaviors. However, direct experimental evidence of spin-phonon polarons has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests itself as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence or quantum sensing performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04885v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10211</link><description>arXiv:2506.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO2) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10211v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] There and Back Again: A Gauging Nexus between Topological and Fracton Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19440</link><description>arXiv:2509.19440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. B 112, 125124 (2025)], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19440v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect Landscape of Orthorhombic Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ from First-Principles Calculations: The Role of Oxygen Interstitials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18602</link><description>arXiv:2510.18602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brownmillerite-type oxide barium indate (Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$, BIO) is a potential electrolyte for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in solid oxide fuel cells. Despite its structural relation to perovskite oxides, the defect chemistry of BIO has remained largely unexplored. Using Density Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented by selected hybrid functional calculations, we evaluate the formation energies, charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial pressure of vacancies, oxygen interstitials, and Frenkel pairs. Our results reveal that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other interstitial configurations show charged states and become the prevailing compensating defect with oxygen vacancies at high oxygen partial pressures. These results provide a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic defects in BIO, setting the stage for future investigations into the diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18602v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fault-tolerant protocols through spacetime concatenation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08918</link><description>arXiv:2504.08918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.08918v4</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

To explore the microscopic mechanism of this effect, we systematically investigate the four &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;-type dopants (Si, Sn, Ge, and Zr) in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, combining first-principles calculations and experimental investigations. The calculation results show that the lower formation energies of Si&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt; and Sn&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt; complexes compared to Ge&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt; and Zr&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt; complexes lead to their higher concentrations and consequently stronger compensation in Si and Sn doping &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under O-rich conditions. Oxygen annealing induces a severe compensation effect, as consistently validated by Hall effect and non-contact eddy current measurements. Beyond this universal mechanism, we further identify that the carrier compensation predominantly occurs near the surface, manifesting as a dramatic drop in near-surface carrier concentration and a sharp increase in contact resistivity in Sn-doped &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Zero-dimensional persistence diagrams for grayscale images extracted carbon-ring interiors as local structures, allowing identification of defect structures. Roundness as a measure of the distortion of carbon rings and polygon number were quantitatively calculated. It was found that electron irradiation increased both the fraction of non-hexagonal polygons and distortion of carbon-atom polygons in graphene. One-dimensional persistence diagrams for polygon-center point clouds after downsampling the center of non-hexagonal polygons yielded large rings that reliably enclosed connected defect clusters ranging from simple defects to complex clusters. These rings also enclosed non-crystalline regions composed of hexagons, which were difficult to capture considering only polygon number. The large rings enable automated counting of the number of each type of polygon within each defect cluster. The number of polygons within defect clusters thereby quantified the connectivity of carbon-atom polygons and revealed that electron-beam irradiation induced the growth of defect clusters in an interconnected manner.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/1/011108/3377735/Multiscale-structural-analysis-of-defective</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] pH‐Responsive Psoralen Delivery System for Infected Bone Defects: Spatiotemporal Photothermal Disinfection Coupled with Osteogenesis and Osteoclast Regulation</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202512756?af=R</link><description>Small, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:50:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202512756</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents] Mapping Antibiotic Photocatalytic Transformation and Resistance Risks with a DFT‐Informed Machine Learning Workflow</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202520124?af=R</link><description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:04:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/anie.202520124</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Molecular Sieve Promoted Growth of Ferroelectric Trilayer 3R‐MoS2 for Polarization‐Dependent Reconfigurable Optoelectronic Synapses</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202524333?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:03:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202524333</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Polaronic-Distortion-Driven Enhancement of Excitonic Auger Recombination in ZnO Nanoparticles</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03576</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03576/asset/images/medium/jz5c03576_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03576&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:29:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03576</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Defect‐Rich 2D Layered Double Hydroxides Enhance Sonodynamic Antibacterial Therapy</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202524216?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:17:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202524216</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Structure‐Function Co‐Assembled Polyphenol‐Diamine Network for Stable, Immunoregulatory, and Contact‐Active Healing of Oral Mucosal Defects</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202528538?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:11:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202528538</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Atomic Defects in Layered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Sustainable Energy Storage and the Intelligent Trends in Data Analytics</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202521502?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:09:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202521502</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

However, traditional sensors often suffer from cross-sensitivity to different variables, making it difficult to separate overlapping effects, such as those caused by temperature and magnetic fields, in complex environments. This challenge highlights the need for robust multiparametric sensors capable of independently and accurately monitoring diverse conditions in real time. In this context, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond present a promising solution. These atomic-scale defects can be optically initialized, manipulated, and read out via laser excitation using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), and they can operate under ambient and harsh conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a simultaneous and internally cross-validated sensing platform capable of detecting both magnetic fields and temperature with a sensitivity of around 500 nT/ Hz and 10 mK/ Hz, respectively. Our method integrates ODMR, zero-phonon line spectral shifts, and linewidth broadening, each providing independent spectral signatures sensitive to distinct physical effects. This approach enhances measurement precision, enables internal consistency checks, and decouples intertwined phenomena such as temperature-induced variations in magnetization.

Abstract: A phase transition is an example of a ``topological defect'' in the space of parameters of a quantum or classical many-body systems. In this paper, we consider phase diagram topological defects of higher codimension. These have the property that equilibrium states undergo some kind of non-trivial winding as one moves around the defect. We show that such topological defects exist even in classical statistical mechanical systems, and describe their general structure in this context. We then introduce the term ``diabolical critical point'' (DCP), which is a higher-codimension analog of a continuous phase transition, with the proximate phases of matter replaced by the non-trivial winding of the proximate equilibrium states. We propose conditions under which a system can have a stable DCP. We also discuss some examples of stable DCPs in (1+1)-dimensional quantum systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10783v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Are Universal Potentials Ready for Alkali-Ion Battery Kinetics?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10938</link><description>arXiv:2601.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating alkali-ion battery discovery requires accurate modeling of atomic-scale kinetics, yet the reliability of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) in capturing these high-energy landscapes remains uncertain. Here, we systematically benchmark state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, GRACE, and Orb, against DFT baselines for cathodes and solid electrolytes. We find that the Orb-v3 family excels in static migration barrier predictions (MAE $\approx$ 75--111 meV), driven primarily by architectural refinements. Conversely, for dynamic transport, the GRACE model trained on the OMat24 dataset demonstrates superior fidelity in reproducing ion diffusivities and structural correlations. Our results reveal that while architectural sophistication (e.g., equivariance) is beneficial, the inclusion of high-temperature, non-equilibrium training data is the dominant driver of kinetic accuracy. These findings establish that modern uMLIPs are sufficiently robust to serve as zero-shot surrogates for high-throughput kinetic screening of next-generation energy storage materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The fate of a single impurity in the Bose-Hubbard model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11058</link><description>arXiv:2601.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map out the global phase diagram of a single mobile impurity in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, spanning the bath evolution from a compressible superfluid (SF) to an incompressible Mott insulator (MI) and the full range of impurity-bath coupling. Using sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo method, we identify two sharply distinct localization mechanisms that organize the entire diagram. In the compressible SF, increasing impurity-bath coupling $|U_{\mathrm{ib}}|$ drives an \emph{interaction-driven winding-collapse crossover}: a light, extended polaron with finite winding evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately a self-trapped state -- a repulsive \emph{saturated bubble} or an attractive \emph{bound cluster} -- even while the bath remains globally superfluid, establishing localization without any bath phase transition. By contrast, upon tuning the bath across the SF-MI transition at fixed impurity-bath coupling $U_{\mathrm{ib}}$, localization becomes \emph{compressibility controlled}: the vanishing bath compressibility quenches polaronic dressing and collapses the impurity-centered density response, converting the polaron into an almost free defect and, deep in the MI, into a fully localized vacancy or particle defect. In the incompressible regime, localization proceeds via \emph{quantized defect formation}, manifested by discrete changes in the total bath occupation. Together, our results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity localization in correlated lattice bosons, governed by winding collapse in the SF and compressibility-driven localization across the SF-MI transition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11058v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Evolution of a Single Impurity Across the Superfluid-Mott insulator Transition in the Bose-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11062</link><description>arXiv:2601.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the coherence and spatial dressing of a single impurity evolve in the two-dimensional Bose--Hubbard model when the impurity couples attractively to the bath. Using large-scale, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the worm algorithm, we track the impurity winding number, the bath superfluid density and compressibility, and impurity--bath density correlations. First, by fixing the bath interaction at $U_{\mathrm{b}}/t=13.3$ in the superfluid regime and tuning the attractive impurity-bath coupling from $U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-1.0$ to $-40.0$, we uncover an interaction-driven winding-collapse localization: the impurity evolves from a mobile light polaron with finite winding to a heavy polaron and, finally, to a bound cluster with vanishing winding, while the bath remains globally superfluid. Second, we analyze impurity in Mott-insulating baths for both attractive and repulsive impurity--bath couplings, contrasting the resulting deformation clouds and localization patterns. Third, for a moderate attractive impurity-bath coupling $U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-8.0$, we tune the bath interaction $U_{\mathrm{b}}/t$ across the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition and find a compressibility-controlled localization crossover of coherent impurity motion. Finally, together with our companion Letter [\emph{The Fate of a Single Impurity in the Bose--Hubbard Model}], which focused on repulsive impurity-bath couplings, these results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity localization in the Bose--Hubbard model, connecting interaction-driven and compressibility-controlled mechanisms across both attractive and repulsive regimes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DFT modelling of stacking faults in hexagonal and cubic GaN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11206</link><description>arXiv:2601.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the energetics, and the atomic and electronic structure, of stacking faults in GaN, both in the stable hexagonal wurtzite (wz) phase and in the metastable cubic zincblende (zb) phase. In wz GaN, SFs on the (0001) planes can be divided into three different intrinsic stacking faults (I1, I2, and I3) and oneextrinsic stacking fault (E). In zb GaN, SFs form along (111) directions, giving one type each of intrinsic, extrinsic and twin SFs. Based on the calculated formation energy, I1 is the most stable SF of wz GaN in agreement with experiment. For zb GaN, the intrinsic stacking fault is the most dominant planar defect. To characterize the effect of the stacking faults on the electronic structure of the material, we examined the band density. We found that the bands near the valence band maximum in wz GaN are localised on the Ga-polar side of the stacking fault (i.e. on the Ga side of the Ga-N bonds perpendicular to the SF), with the bands near the conduction band minimum more on the N-polar side, though somewhat delocalised. We found the opposite trend in zb GaN; this behaviour is caused by a redistribution of charge near the interface. We also show the band offsets for the stacking faults, finding that they are very sensitive to local conditions, but can all be described as type II interfaces, with the presence of a stacking fault reducing the gap locally.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11206v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-equilibrium geometric forces steer spiral waves on folded surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11321</link><description>arXiv:2601.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral waves are ubiquitous signatures of non equilibrium dynamics, appearing across chemical, biological, and active systems. Yet, in many living systems these waves unfold on curved and folded surfaces whose geometry has rarely been treated as a dynamical factor. Here we show that surface curvature fundamentally shapes spiral wave behavior and can contribute to the organization of neural activity in the brain. Via analytical theory and simulations of the complex Ginzburg Landau equation (CGLE) on curved surfaces, we demonstrate that curvature enters through the Laplace Beltrami operator as a spatial modulation of effective diffusion. Gradients of this effective diffusion generate a geometric force on spiral defects, and the complex nature of the CGLE produces a complex mobility that leads to non central and non reciprocal responses. Applied to realistic cortical surfaces of the human brain, the model predicts that the pattern of cortical folding stabilizes and localizes spiral waves, while progressive smoothing of the surface erases these non equilibrium structures. This reveals that brain geometry is not a passive scaffold but an active physical constraint that shapes neural dynamics. More broadly, the same geometric mechanism provides a universal route by which curvature and topology control pattern formation across oscillatory, chemical, and active matter systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11321v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Halide diffusion in mixed-halide perovskites and heterojunctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11503</link><description>arXiv:2601.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration of halide defects guides ion transport in metal halide perovskites and controls the kinetics of halide mixing and phase separation.

We observe enhanced diffusion of both vacancies and interstitials in the mixed halide compounds compared to the single halide ones, as well as a difference in mobility between Br and I ions in the mixed compound. Diffusion across heterojunctions is governed by the interface structure, where a Br-rich interface blocks migration of vacancies in particular, but an I-rich interface is permeable.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11503v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Geometrical optical activity induced by a continuous distribution of screw dislocations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10841</link><description>arXiv:2601.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study light propagation in a medium with uniform torsion, modeled as a continuum of screw dislocations within the geometric theory of defects. By solving Maxwell's equations in covariant form, we show that torsion induces intrinsic chirality and circular birefringence: right- and left-circular polarizations acquire different wavenumbers, leading to a purely geometric optical activity. The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $\Delta\theta = \Omega\rho L$, linear in the dislocation density $\Omega$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $\rho$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $\Delta n = 2c\Omega\rho/\omega$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms. We also show that the same spiral geometry implements a broadband geometric phase gate for polarization qubits and has an electronic analogue on the surface of cylindrical topological insulators, where torsion shears the Dirac cone, establishing a unified geometric link between torsion, optical activity, and topological electronic responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10841v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Getting the manifold right: The crucial role of orbital resolution in DFT+U for mixed d-f electron compounds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16435</link><description>arXiv:2508.16435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling compounds with partially filled $d$ and $f$ shells remains a hard challenge for density-functional theory, due to large self-interaction errors stemming from local or semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Hubbard $U$ corrections can mitigate such errors, but are often detrimental to the description of hybridized states, leading to spurious force contributions and wrong lattice structures. Here, we show that careful disentanglement of localized and delocalized states leads to accurate predictions of electronic states and structural distortions in ternary monouranates (AUO$_4$, where A represents Mn, Co, or Ni), for which standard $U$ corrections generally fail. Crucial to achieving such accuracy is a minimization of the mismatch between the spatial extension of the projector functions and the true coordination geometry. This requires Wannier-like alternatives to atomic-orbital projector functions, or corrections of Hubbard manifolds exclusively comprised of the most localized A-$3d$, U-$5f$ and O-$2p$ orbitals. These findings open up the computational prediction of fundamental properties of actinide solids of critical technological importance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16435v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] pyRMG: A Framework for High-Throughput, Large-Cell DFT Calculations on Supercomputers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16775</link><description>arXiv:2509.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exascale computing delivers the raw power to simulate ever larger and more chemically realistic systems, but realizing this potential requires codes that can efficiently use thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) density functional theory (DFT) code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). However, the limited workflow infrastructure for RMG has thus far constrained its adoption to a small user community. In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE computational materials science Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which offers chemical insights into this system and shows that RMG-based workflows can converge with limited user intervention.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16775v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Statistics makes a difference: Machine learning adsorption dynamics of functionalized cyclooctine on Si(001) at DFT accuracy</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00420A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00420A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hendrik  Weiske, Rhyan  Barrett, Ralf Tonner-Zech, Patrick Melix, Julia Westermayr&lt;br /&gt;The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs.

Abstract: We report on a new flux quantization phenomenon in metals. We study the response of normal metals to the presence of localized magnetic flux. We find that, due to backreaction effects, the metal traps 0 flux or $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ flux (half flux). We exhibit this effect both for metals pierced by magnetic solenoids and metals wrapping a magnetic solenoid. In the latter case we demonstrate the trapping of magnetic flux analytically. Furthermore, we find that as the solenoid is adiabatically turned off, a logarithmically enhanced localized equilibrium current persists, reflecting perfect defect-diamagnetism of the Fermi gas.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological textures and emergent altermagnetic signatures in ultrathin BiFeO3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09970</link><description>arXiv:2601.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics, materials with intrinsically coupled electric polarization and magnetic order, promise ultralow-power switching, nonvolatile memory, and energy-efficient signal transduction. Yet practical deployment demands ultrathin films down to the atomic limit, where both orders typically degrade. Maintaining both order parameters at the thinnest scales in complex oxides remains a tremendous challenge, as uncompensated bound charge drives nanoscale depolarization in most ferroelectrics, while off-stoichiometry, reduced anisotropy, and charge transfer can produce magnetic dead layers in ultrathin oxides at substrate interfaces. Here, we realize a multiferroic phase of BiFeO3 that not only sustains both order parameters at room temperature with no dead layer but also exhibits signatures of emergent altermagnetism in the four-unit-cell, ultrathin limit. First-principles calculations, spin symmetry analysis, atomic-resolution imaging, and angle-resolved magnetic imaging reveal that short-circuit electrostatic boundary conditions, together with epitaxial strain, drive a continuous second-order, thickness-driven phase transition that enables the formation of multiferroic topological textures. Moreover, the imposed boundary conditions stabilize a d-wave altermagnetic time-reversal symmetry breaking, with corresponding signatures observed in magnetic circular dichroism. Collectively, these results establish a pathway to stabilize unconventional multiferroicity at device-relevant thicknesses, reframing scaling limits for oxide electronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Comprehensive Molecular-level Understanding of MgO Hydration through Computational Chemistry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10186</link><description>arXiv:2601.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydration of magnesium oxide (MgO) to magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)$_2$) is a fundamental solid-surface chemical reaction with significant implications for materials science. Yet its molecular-level mechanism from water adsorption to Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth remains elusive due to its complex and multi-step nature. Here, we elucidate the molecular process of MgO hydration based on structures of the MgO/water interface obtained by a combined computational chemistry approach of potential-scaling molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations without any a priori assumptions about reaction pathways. The result shows that the Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution follows the dissociative water adsorption. We find that this initial dissolution can proceed exothermically even from the defect-free surface with an average activation barrier of $\sim$12 kcal/mol. This exothermicity depends crucially on the stabilization of the resulting surface vacancy, achieved by proton adsorption onto neighboring surface oxygen atoms. Further Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution then occurs in correlation with proton penetration into the solid. Moreover, we find that the Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth proceeds according to the dissolution-precipitation mechanism, rather than a solid-state reaction mechanism involving a direct topotactic transformation. In this process, Mg$^{2+}$ ions migrate away from the surface and form amorphous Mg-OH chains as precursors for Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation. We also demonstrate that sufficient water facilitates the formation of more ordered crystalline nuclei. This computational study provides a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of MgO hydration, representing a foundational step toward elucidating the mechanisms of this class of complex and multi-step solid-surface chemical reactions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topology-Directed Silicide Formation: An Explanation for the Growth of C49-TiSi$_2$ on the Si(100) Surface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10368</link><description>arXiv:2601.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing metal-semiconductor junctions is essential for optimizing the performance of modern nanoelectronic devices. A widely used material is TiSi$_2$, which combines low electronic resistivity with good endurance. However, its multitude of polymorphs continues to pose a challenge for device fabrication. In particular, the naturally occurring formation of the metastable C49-TiSi$_2$ modification remains poorly understood and is problematic due to its unfavorable electronic properties. Based on extensive DFT calculations, we present a comprehensive model of Ti adsorption on Si(100) that highlights the pivotal role of surface topology for the initial stages of the interfacial TiSi$_2$ formation process. We show that the interplay between Si surface dimers, the symmetry of the Si(100) surface, and the incorporation of Ti adsorbates below the surface drives an adsorption pattern that yields a nucleation template for the C49-TiSi$_2$ phase. Our atomistic model rationalizes experimental observations like the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode, the preferential formation of C49-TiSi$_2$ despite it being less favorable than the competing C54 phase, and why disruption of the surface structure restores thermodynamically driven growth of the latter. Ultimately, this novel perspective on the unique growth of TiSi$_2$ will help to pave the way for next-generation electronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10368v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Incipient modulated phase in Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_3$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10516</link><description>arXiv:2601.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanometer-scale modulations can spontaneously emerge in complex materials when multiple degrees of freedom interact. Here we demonstrate that ferroelectric Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$ lies in close proximity to an incipient structurally modulated phase. Using inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering, we show that upon cooling, dipolar fluctuations strongly couple to and soften the $c_{44}$ transverse acoustic mode. We identify the wavevector at which this softening is maximal, thereby defining the characteristic length scale of the modulation. Calcium substitution enhances both the amplitude and the wavevector of the softening by strengthening the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear flexoelectric phonon coupling tends to stabilize a modulated state that cooperates with, rather than competes against, the other lattice instabilities in SrTiO$_3$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergent electric field induced by dissipative sliding dynamics of domain walls in a Weyl magnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10638</link><description>arXiv:2601.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10638v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fragmented Topological Excitations in Generalized Hypergraph Product Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09850</link><description>arXiv:2601.09850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product code construction is a powerful tool for constructing quantum stabilizer codes, which serve as a promising paradigm for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, the natural mapping between stabilizer codes and the ground states of exactly solvable spin models also motivates the exploration of many-body orders in the stabilizer codes. In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09850v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Spin Squeezing in Power-Law Interacting XXZ Models with Disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10703</link><description>arXiv:2601.10703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10703v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17488</link><description>arXiv:2412.17488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.17488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Monte Carlo Simulations of Crystal Defects in Open Ensembles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12985</link><description>arXiv:2506.12985v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16916v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Neural Network Architectures on Li$^+$-Ion Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolyte from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Machine-Learning Force Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11650</link><description>arXiv:2512.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques for materials simulations, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have become a powerful tool that complements first-principles calculations by enabling high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations over extended timescales. Typically, MLFFs are trained on data generated from density functional theory (DFT) using a specific exchange-correlation (XC) functional, with the goal of reproducing DFT-level properties. However, the uncertainties in MLFF-based simulations--arising from variations in both MLFF model architectures and the choice of XC functionals--remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we construct MLFF models of different architectures trained on DFT data from both semilocal and hybrid functionals to describe Li$^+$ diffusion in the solid-state electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. We systematically investigate how different XC functionals influence the Li$^+$ diffusion coefficient. To reduce statistical uncertainty, the mean squared displacements are averaged over 300 independent molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of 70 ps each, yielding statistical variations below $1\%$. This enables a clear assessment of the respective influences of the functional and the MLFF model. Due to its tendency to underestimate band gaps and migration barriers, the semilocal functional predicts consistently higher Li$^+$ diffusion coefficients, compared to the hybrid functional. Furthermore, comparisons among various neural network methods reveal that the differences in predicted diffusion coefficients arising from different network architectures are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by different functionals, indicating that the choice of the network model itself substantially influences the MLFF predictions. This observation calls from an urgent need for standardized protocols to minimize model-dependent biases in MLFF-based MD.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11650v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link><description>arXiv:2601.00744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau-de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\ep = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\ep \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\ep)$ correction to the director field, in contrast to the $O(1/\ep^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Importantly, a stability analysis based on the intrinsic-basis decomposition shows that even small deviations of $O(1/\ep^2)$ from perfect scalar order can destabilise some Oseen-Frank solutions, indicating that only a restricted subset of solutions are realised as stable equilibria in the full Landau-de Gennes theory. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. These results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for modelling nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00744v5</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] YBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3.5+δ&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;: A family of semiconductors with a charge- and defect-tunable triple fluorite layer</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-m3qv9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Abstract: The design and development of new materials is crucial for advanced next-generation technologies, necessitating the modification of materials with tuneable atomic and electronic frameworks.

Field-induced stabilization of adsorbed CO2 is commonly attributed to interaction between the applied electric field and the intrinsic molecular dipole of CO2. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) with an explicit external electric field, we re-examine this paradigm by systematically studying CO2 electrosorption on FCC(111) surfaces of Ag, Au, Cu, Ir, Pb, and Pt. We identify a clear electric-field-driven transition between physisorbed and chemisorbed CO2. Physisorption preserves a near-linear geometry with negligible charge transfer and weak field dependence, whereas chemisorption involves pronounced bending, substantial electron transfer from the metal, and strong stabilization at increasing negative fields. We show that this switching cannot be explained by the molecular CO2 dipole alone. Instead, it is governed by interaction of the electric field with an interfacial metal–CO2 dipole formed upon charge transfer. This interpretation provides a physically grounded reinterpretation of CO2 electrosorption and clarifies how strong interfacial fields drive the transition from physisorption to chemisorption.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1w0qb?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Stereospecific nucleophilic substitution at all-carbon quaternary centers of 3,3-dialkylcyclobutanones with chloride</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8dx37?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We investigated stereospecific nucleophilic substitution of optically active 3,3-dialkylcyclobutanones with chloride ion to afford ring-cleaved 3-chloro-3,3-dialkyl ketones in the presence of TiCl4 and Me3SiCl.

The addition of silver enhances the ethylene selectivity. Experimental evidence was supported by DFT calculations predicting Gibbs free energies and adsorption energies as a function of catalyst composition. Comprehensive characterization was carried out using ICP, XRF, XRD, N₂-physisorption, TPR, STEM-EDX, and XPS. This work is inspired by the need for more sustainable catalysts beyond Pd for the removal of trace amounts of acetylene from the ethylene under front-end conditions downstream of industrial steam crackers for olefin production. Conventional Pd-based catalysts, though highly active, suffer from limited selectivity, high cost, and environmental concerns. Iron emerges as a sustainable alternative due to its abundance, low toxicity, and favorable hydrogenation activity. Incorporation of silver into iron catalysts leverages synergistic effects that allow to tune the performance of the catalysts. These effects result in enhanced catalytic activity and improved selectivity towards ethylene. The present work demonstrates a promising approach for developing cost-effective, sustainable, and highly active catalysts for industrial acetylene hydrogenation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-v13ww?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Multifaceted Lewis Acidity of a High-Valent Cu(III) complex</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-34318?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Copper(III) compounds are of crucial importance in biological systems and aerobic oxidative processes, whereas their Lewis acidity, a key reactivity feature, is barely studied.

Abstract: We present a rigorous analysis that combines theory, simulation, and experimental measurements to quantify the relationship between strain and bandgap in two dimensional gallium selenide (Ga$_2$Se$_2$). Experimentally, we transfer thin Ga$_2$Se$_2$ flakes onto patterned substrates to deterministically induce multiaxial localized strain. We quantify the local strain using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. We then experimentally map the strain-induced bandgap shifts using high-resolution hyperspectral PL imaging to generate a robust and statistically significant dataset. We systematically fit this data to extract gauge factors that relate the bandgap shift to the local uniaxial and biaxial strain. We then compute the uniaxial and biaxial strain gauge factors via density functional theory (DFT) and find excellent agreement with the experimentally-determined values. Finally, we show that a simple model that computes bandgap shifts from the local uniaxial and biaxial strain predicts the observed multiaxial bandgap shift with less than 10\% error. The combined results provide a framework for deterministic realization of tailored bandgap profiles induced by controlled strain applied to Ga$_2$Se$_2$, with implications for the future realization of localized quantum emitters for quantum photonic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unexpected type-II multiferroic phase in GdMnO3 under high magnetic fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09092</link><description>arXiv:2601.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite manganites with small A-site ions, as the first and canonical branch of type-II multiferroics, are ideal systems to exhibit magnetism-induced ferroelectricity. Despite their established magnetoelectric phase diagrams under low magnetic fields, here an unidentified phase with a large magnetism-induced polarization (up to 1500 {\mu}C/m2) is revealed in GdMnO3 under high magnetic fields up to 60 T. Based on multiprobe experiments, a complete phase diagram is constructed with successive polar-nonpolar-polar-nonpolar transitions. Such a nonmonotonic evolution is well mimicked by model simulation, while the spin-lattice coupling is the key ingredient for the reentrant ferroelectric phase.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09092v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entropic Colloidal Crystal Prediction: A Quantum Density Functional Theory Inspired Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09192</link><description>arXiv:2601.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of a colloidal analogue to quantum density functional theory (DFT) predictions of atomic crystal structures, we report a new, classical DFT that predicts the relative thermodynamic stability of colloidal crystals of hard, convex particle shapes. In contrast to standard classical DFT approaches, our theory maps the hard particle system to an auxiliary system in which we treat the particles as fixed "nuclei" embedded in a fictitious, spatially varying density field that distributes throughout the auxiliary system. By minimizing the free energy of the auxiliary system, and through comparison with known equations of state and free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration, we show that the auxiliary system with the lowest free energy corresponds to the most probable crystal of hard shapes in the original system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunnel-Barrier-Engineered Ultrafast Demagnetization and Spin Transport in Graphene-Based Heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09284</link><description>arXiv:2601.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining graphene with 3d transition metal ferromagnets (FMs) enable various spin-based phenomena at ultrafast timescales. However, challenges such as the interfacial impedance mismatch, FM deposition-induced defect generation, and interface modification by interfacial coupling or hybridization can impede their functionalization for spin-orbitronics. In this work, we utilize insulating TiOx barrier layers (BLs) to modify the interfacial spin conductance structurally, disentangle spin pumping and magnetic proximity effects (MPE), and establish external control over ultrafast magnetization dynamics in single-layer graphene/TiOx/Co systems. All-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of femtosecond to nanosecond spin dynamics reveal systematic tunability of ultrafast magnetic parameters via barrier engineering. The thickness-dependent damping modulation in Co indicates strong spin pumping, with interfacial spin transparency close to half its physical limit in the presence of an ultrathin BL, where MPE is eliminated. Our results show that appropriately chosen ultrathin BLs can prevent interfacial alterations from ferromagnetic metals, facilitating efficient spin detection in graphene and enhancing control over spin angular momentum dissipation in graphene/FM interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chemical heterogeneity at conducting ferroelectric domain walls</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09323</link><description>arXiv:2601.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural interfaces in ferroic oxides have developed into versatile playgrounds for studying electronic correlation effects in 2D systems. The microscopic origin of the emergent local electronic properties is often debated, however, as quantitative atomic-scale characterization remains challenging. A prime example is enhanced conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls, attributed to mechanisms ranging from local band gap reduction to point defect accumulations. Here, we resolve the microscopic mechanisms for domain wall conduction in the ferroelectric model system BiFeO3, by combining transport measurements with atom probe tomography to quantify the local chemical composition and correlate it with the electrical properties. Significant chemical variations along the walls are observed, demonstrating an outstanding chemical flexibility at domain walls, which manifest in spatially varying physical properties. The results give a unifying explanation for the diverse electronic behavior observed and establish the fundamental notion that multiple conduction mechanisms can coexist within individual domain walls.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Diffusion Kinetics of Ba Cations in Perovskite BaTiO$_3$: A Combined Tracer Diffusion and Metadynamics Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09344</link><description>arXiv:2601.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracer diffusion experiments and metadynamics (MtD) simulations were used to study the diffusion of Ba cations in the cubic phase of the perovskite oxide BaTiO$_3$. $^{130}$BaTiO$_3$ thin films were used as diffusion sources to introduce barium tracer diffusion profiles into single-crystal samples at temperatures $1348 \leq T/\mathrm{K} \leq 1498$. The $^{130}$Ba profiles were determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and then analysed to yield Ba tracer diffusion coefficients ($D_\mathrm{Ba}^\ast$). MtD simulations were performed in order to obtain barium-vacancy diffusion coefficients ($D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$) for selected vacancy mechanisms as a function of temperature. $D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$ is predicted to be increased significantly by an adjacent oxygen vacancy, and even more, by an adjacent titanium vacancy. From the combined consideration of $D_\mathrm{Ba}^\ast$ and $D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$, we conclude that Ba diffusion in these samples occurred most probably by the migration of defect associates, and not by the migration of isolated barium vacancies. More generally, our results draw attention to the dangers of relying solely on activation enthalpies to interpret diffusion data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric polarization mapping through pseudosymmetry-sensitive EBSD reindexing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09627</link><description>arXiv:2601.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials exhibit a switchable, spontaneous polarization at the unit cell level--an attractive property utilized in many emerging technologies including, among others, high-density memory storage, low-power transistors, and high-speed fiber optic communication. Understanding the local polarization switching behavior, through domain nucleation and evolution, is critical to advancing these technologies and requires characterization of the local domain microstructure. However, in application-relevant polycrystalline materials exhibiting a distribution of grain orientations, a direct mapping of the polarization direction in three dimensions has remained inaccessible using conventional experimental approaches. Here, taking barium titanate single crystals and lead zirconium titanate polycrystals as our bulk model systems, we map the local polarization directions using a new electron backscatter diffraction indexing technique based on simulated pattern-matching. Through improved pre-processing techniques (including optimized pattern processing, a new pseudosymmetry-sensitive neighbor pattern averaging method, and DIC-based global sample-detector geometry calibration) and a new pseudosymmetry confidence index (which considers not only pattern similarity but pattern dissimilarity trends with other domain variant patterns), we successfully distinguish between the six polarization directions, despite the challengingly small unit cell aspect ratio of the selected materials. The methods developed in this work are not only applicable to ferroelectrics but any material which exhibits close crystallographic pseudosymmetries--extending the current capabilities of EBSD.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09627v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Measurable geometric indicators of local plasticity in glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09391</link><description>arXiv:2410.09391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of defects in crystalline phases of matter has been extremely powerful for understanding crystal growth, deformation and melting. Many of these discontinuities in the periodic order of crystals are well described by the Burgers vector, derived from the particle displacements, which encapsulates the direction and magnitude of slip relative to the undeformed state. Since the reference structure of the crystal is known a priori, the Burgers vector can be determined experimentally using both imaging and diffraction methods to measure the final lattice distortion, and thus infer the particle displacements. Glasses have structures that lack the periodicity of crystals, and thus a well-defined reference state. Yet, measurable structural parameters can still be obtained from diffraction from a glass. Here we examine the usefulness of these parameters to probe deformation in glasses. We find that co-ordinated transformations in the centrosymmetry of local particle arrangements are a strong marker of plastic events. For a glass, determining the local distortions corresponding to these plastic events requires measurements before and after deformation. We investigate two geometric indicators that can be derived from these distortions, namely the continuous Burgers vector and the quadrupolar strain. We find that the Burgers vector again emerges as a robust and sensitive metric for understanding local structural transformations due to mechanical deformation, even in disordered glasses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.09391v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364</link><description>arXiv:2507.18364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic order on ultrafast timescales, driven by spintronic and recording applications, is one of the main directions of current research in magnetism. Despite major advances in understanding the temporal evolution of magnetic order upon its emergence or quenching, experimental demonstration of the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation is missing. Here, taking advantage of the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ transmission electron microscopy, we observe that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition of FeRh thin films, causing the transition to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a decrease of 20 K in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices as preferential nucleation motifs. These vortices are pinned in the film by underlying dislocation networks. We observe that the dislocation networks are formed and rearranged upon repeated crossing of the phase transition using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Our results establish a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase, with broad implications for ultrafast stroboscopic experiments and defect-mediated phase transitions in functional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18364v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Defect Formation Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Crossover Transitions with Approximate Symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05964</link><description>arXiv:2508.05964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous second-order phase transitions is well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate, such transitions become smooth crossovers, and the applicability of KZM in these scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing both a weakly coupled Ginzburg-Landau model and a strongly coupled holographic setup, each featuring pseudo-spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. In the slow quench regime, we observe a breakdown of the universal power-law scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. Specifically, the defect density acquires an exponential correction dependent on the quench rate, following a universal form dictated by the source of explicit symmetry breaking. Although these dynamics extend beyond the scope of the traditional KZM, we demonstrate that a generalized framework, that incorporates the effects of explicit symmetry breaking into the dynamical correlation length, remains valid and accurately captures the non-equilibrium defect formation across the entire range of quench rates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05964v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] About carrier's self-trapping and dynamical Rashba splitting in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12129</link><description>arXiv:2508.12129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) is employed to monitor photoexcited electrons in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$. Photoelectron intensity maps are in good agreement with ab-initio calculations of the band structure. The effective mass is $-0.18 \pm 0.02 m_e$ and $0.12 \pm 0.02 m_e$ for holes and electrons, respectively. In the photoexcited state, spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band cannot be resolved. This sets the upper bound of photoinduced Rashba coupling to $\alpha_C&lt;2.5$ eV\AA. The correlated electron-hole plasma evolves in Wannier excitons with Bohr radius of 2.8 nm, while no sign of self-trapping in small polarons is found within the investigated time window of up to 120 ps following photoexcitation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12129v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation-point defect interaction on plasticity across the length scale in SrTiO3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18620</link><description>arXiv:2510.18620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point defect engineering is widely used to tailor the electronic and transport properties of complex oxides, yet its influence on dislocation plasticity remains poorly understood. Here, we establish how donor (Nb) doping modifies dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and mobility in single-crystal SrTiO3 by bridging nano-, meso-, and macroscale deformation. Using a combinatorial approach involving nanoindentation, cyclic Brinell indentation, and bulk uniaxial compression, we show that 0.5 wt% Nb doping consistently suppresses room-temperature plasticity. Nanoindentation reveals increased pop-in stresses, increased lattice friction stress, and reduced creep rates, indicating inhibited dislocation nucleation and motion with Nb doping. Mesoscale Brinell indentation exhibits discrete, widely spaced slip traces reflecting more difficult dislocation multiplication. Bulk uniaxial compression confirms ~50% higher yield stress in Nb-doped (0.5 wt%) SrTiO3 samples. Comparison with Fe-doped SrTiO3 (equivalent doping concentration) isolates the role of defect chemistry: oxygen vacancies promote incipient plasticity, whereas Sr vacancies dominate in Nb-doped SrTiO3, strongly hindering dislocation motion. This length-scale bridging approach consistently reveals suppressed dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and motion in the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples. These insights underline the importance of dislocation-defect chemistry on the mechanical behavior of functional oxides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18620v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] 't Hooft Anomalies and Defect Conformal Manifolds: Topological Signatures from Modulated Effective Actions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15466</link><description>arXiv:2507.15466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries by extended dynamical defects entails the existence of defect families, which form conformal manifolds in a critical setup. In the presence of bulk 't Hooft anomalies, defects are in fact required to break the symmetry: defect conformal manifolds are anomaly-enforced. We show that, by coupling the system to a modulated deformation parameter, the geometric structure of the conformal manifold is sensitive to the 't Hooft anomaly. This leads to measurable effects in the presence of a boundary/defect: in (1+1)d the anomaly predicts a quantized boundary charge pumping, while in higher dimensions it gives rise to non-dissipative boundary Hall currents.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.15466v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link><description>arXiv:2601.08054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08054v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08296</link><description>arXiv:2601.08296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08296v2</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Enhancing hydrogen storage performance of graphdiyne through high-vacancy defects and lithium functionalization: A density functional theory study</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X26001301?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 March 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 150&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Said Elghazi, Hamid Ez-Zahraouy&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:21:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X26001301</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] DFT-guided discovery of bisureido ester of 2-(methylthio)ethanol: A novel lead against triple-negative breast cancer inducing apoptosis via pH-sensitive chloride transport</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tql3f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Dysregulation of transmembrane chloride flux has emerged as a promising strategy for inducing cancer-cell death through disruption of intracellular pH gradients and subsequent apoptosis. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of novel ortho-phenylenediamine (o-PDA) bisurea derivatives bearing carboxyl (5a–f) and 2-(methylthio)ethyl ester (6a,b) groups for pH-sensitive anion transport and resultant anticancer activity. Esterification of 5c–f proved synthetically challenging due to an unprecedented CDI-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization that yielded the 4-oxo-benzo[d][1,3,6]oxadiazepines 8a,b, rationalized via a DFT-supported four-step mechanism involving hydrogen-borrowing catalysis. All target compounds demonstrated 1:1 chloride ion-binding as shown by 1H NMR titration results and demonstrated a pH-gradient-induced transmembrane chloride transport (as shown by vesicular transport studies) which was enhanced by electron-withdrawing substituents on the outer phenyl rings. Ester derivatives 6a,b exhibited significantly higher chloride binding and up to ~67-fold increased transport efficiency over their carboxylic acid analogs. Compound 6b emerged as the lead, combining efficient chloride binding (Ka = 163 M⁻¹), potent transport (EC50 = 0.007 mol%), and superior antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 6.34 µM) against MDA-MB-231 cells via apoptosis induction. These findings establish 6b as a promising lead for chloride-transport-mediated cancer therapy, with further optimization recommended via EWG diversification and strategic consideration of the cyclization pathway in retrosynthetic design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tql3f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Chem Catalysis] Generalizing reactivity for machine-learning potentials</title><link>https://www.cell.com/chem-catalysis/fulltext/S2667-1093(25)00311-2?rss=yes</link><description>In a recent Nature Catalysis paper, Hu, Xie, and co-workers present an element-based machine-learning potential trained with REICO (random exploration via “imaginary chemical” optimization).

The most well-known reliability issue is the “CO puzzle” as standard density functional theory (DFT) often predicts the wrong adsorption site and overbinds CO on transition-metal surfaces that affect modeling CO oxidation, water-gas shift, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and methanol synthesis among others. Here we show that a simple, self-consistent DFT+U scheme applied to the C and O p orbitals provides a practical route to resolve the CO puzzle. We find that a single DFT+U fit generally restores the experimental site preference, vibrational frequency, and adsorption energies within ±0.1 eV across Ag(111), Au(111), Co(0001), Cu(111), Ir(111), Pd(111), Pt(111), Ni(111), Rh(111), and Ru(0001) surfaces for several exchange-correlation functionals, with revPBE-D3(0)+U agreeing best with experiments. In addition, the same DFT+U fit allows to correct the O₂ gas-phase atomization energy, another great challenge in catalyst modeling. Partial density of states analysis confirms that the +U correction moves the 2π* orbital levels of CO favorably toward experimental photoemission measurements providing a physical motivation why the correction works in general. DFT+U is an ideal solution to retain a fully variational and geometry-optimizable framework that can be deployed easily to study CO binding to transition metal surfaces in established computational workflows.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-56chp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Insights into the Structure and Adsorption Properties of a Novel Aluminum L-Aspartate Metal-Organic Frame-work</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-lgd8x?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Herein we report on the green synthesis of the novel aluminum-based metal organic framework (MOF) Al(OH)( L -Asp) (L-H2Asp = L-aspartic acid; Al-L-Asp) isostructural to Al-fumarate. The synthesis was performed in mild conditions by using GVL (GVL = γ-valero lactone), a solvent derived from biomasses valorization. The MOF structure, modelled through DFT calculations, is consti-tuted of 1D-infinite Al-hydroxo chains connected by the carboxylic groups of L-aspartic acid with a framework topology similar to that of Al-MIL-53. Al-L-Asp displays thermal stability up to 240 °C and no breathing effects are observed upon thermal activa-tion. SS-NMR was used to investigate the activation process and chemical details of the pore structure and of the activation dy-namics. The activated MOF has been exploited in carbon dioxide adsorption. The BET surface area is about 600 m2g-1 and the MOF CO2 capture capacity reaches 3.2 mmol∙g-1 at T = 0° C and pCO2 = 1 bar. Remarkably, compared to the Al-fumarate analogue the CO2 heat of adsorption is increased from about 20 kJ∙mol-1 to a value of 30 kJ∙mol-1, proving the beneficial effect of the pres-ence of an amino-group on the linker skeleton on the CO2-MOF interaction. CO2/N2 IAST selectivity is relatively high, ranging from 60 to more than 80 at increasing pressure range (from 0.1 to 1 bar). These values overcome those measured for the analogue fumarate MOF and they are comparable to the benchmark compounds for CO2 in post-combustion adsorption applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-lgd8x?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Temperature-dependent wake-up phenomena in AlScN ferrodiode memory devices</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022903/3377478/Temperature-dependent-wake-up-phenomena-in-AlScN</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Ferroelectric aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) is a promising material for use in nonvolatile digital memory operating at temperatures well above the limits of current commercial technology. Ferrodiodes consisting of thin films of AlScN sandwiched between metal contacts exhibit polarization-dependent electrical conduction that can distinguish the on/off memory state with bias voltages below 10 V. However, the reliability and repeatability of key device parameters such as switching voltage and on/off ratio can change significantly with temperature. Understanding the temperature dependence of the material parameters that govern these phenomena is critical to the development of practical memory devices operating reliably at high temperature. We have systematically studied the changes in wake-up-like behavior in 40 nm AlScN films from room temperature to 700 °C. Above 300 °C, an anomalous decrease in device current arises when the applied voltage exceeds the minimum switching voltage. The temperature and rate dependence of the anomalous current loss suggests that thermally activated changes to the interlayer near the top electrode alter the local charged defect compensation. This causes the leakage current to decrease even while the net remnant polarization in the films increases.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022903/3377478/Temperature-dependent-wake-up-phenomena-in-AlScN</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia] General linear correction method for DFT+&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; energy: application to U-M (M=Al, Ga, In) alloys under high pressure</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645426000418?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 14 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Acta Materialia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Xiao L.

Abstract: Defect engineering via parallel cracks has been proposed as a route to tailor the fracture response of graphene. However, atomistic fracture predictions can be strongly sensitive to the interatomic potential. Here, we quantify the effect of potential choice by revisiting H-passivated graphene containing two parallel cracks separated by a gap $W_{\text{gap}}$ loaded in tension along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. Molecular dynamics simulations using the AIREBO potential under the same geometry and loading protocol previously studied with ReaxFF, are employed, so enabling a direct comparison. Stress-strain responses, Young's modulus, an effective mode-I stress intensity factor, and energy absorption are evaluated as functions of $W_{\text{gap}}$. Compared with ReaxFF, AIREBO predicts lower peak stresses and earlier catastrophic softening, leading to reduced post-peak deformation capacity and energy absorption. Ductility and energy absorption are shown to be highly potential-dependent, underscoring the need for careful potential selection in defect-engineered graphene fracture simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link><description>arXiv:2601.08054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, identifying magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08296</link><description>arXiv:2601.08296v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: We study Coulomb correlation effects and their role in superconductivity of $\varepsilon$-iron under pressure from 12 to 33 GPa by using a combination of density functional and dynamical mean-field theory. Our results indicate a persistence of the Fermi-liquid behavior below the temperature $\sim$1000 K. The Coulomb correlations are found to substantially renormalize the density of states, reducing the distance from the peak to the Fermi level to 0.4 eV compared to 0.75 eV obtained in DFT calculations. We find significant antiferromagnetic correlations, which are accompanied by the formation of short-lived local magnetic moments. We use the obtained results as a starting point for construction of the multi-band Bethe-Salpeter equation, which eigenvalues indicate that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations may result in the superconducting pairing in $\varepsilon$-Fe. Moreover, the tendency to superconducting instability becomes weaker with the increase of pressure, which may explain the disappearance of superconductivity at $\sim$30 GPa.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2002.01909v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene with Wide Band Gap Opening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10238</link><description>arXiv:2504.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene transferred on nickel grids is herein reported. The hydrogen bonding was found to be favoured for a more distorted graphene lattice. With X ray photoemission spectroscopy on the C 1s core-level, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$ distortion was observed after the hydrogenation of a more $sp^3$-like defected graphene, while a flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, graphene reached a 62$\%$ $sp^3$ saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy showed the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching for the 100$\%$ $sp^3$ sample and a significant reduction for the other one. The high loading levels of hydrogenation led to the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The C-H stretching vibrational mode was also observed, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 62$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10238v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Selective reflection of light in glassforming ternary liquid crystalline mixtures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17633</link><description>arXiv:2509.17633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two ternary liquid crystalline mixtures are formulated and investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Paraelectric smectic A*, ferroelectric smectic C*, and antiferroelectric smectic C$_A$* phases are detected. The glass of the smectic C$_A$* phase is formed at moderate cooling rates.

One mixture shows a strong thermochromic effect in the smectic C$_A$* phase and selectively reflects blue light in the glassy state. Both mixtures reflect either green or red light in the smectic C* phase, depending on temperature treatment: whether the sample is cooled or heated, or at which rate the temperature changes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17633v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable magnetic anisotropy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07465</link><description>arXiv:2510.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\% lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick, maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and +0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry. Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices. Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07465v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magneto-optical-electric joint-measurement scanning imaging system for identification of two-dimensional vdW multiferroic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05363</link><description>arXiv:2307.05363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an advanced imaging system, the magneto-optical-electric joint-measurement scanning imaging system (MOEJSI) brings spectroscopic techniques with unmatched spatial resolution to very low temperature, high magnetic field and high electric field measurements. It was developed for investigating the magnetic and ferroelectric properties and their mutual control through magneto-optical-electric joint-measurements, besides Raman and photoluminescence features. In particular, the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) loops and imaging, linear dichroism (LD) imaging and polarization-electric field hysteresis loop can be achieved when simultaneously applied high magnetic field (7 T) and electric field (100 V) at low temperature of 10 K.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2307.05363v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Energy] Regulation of hydrothermal kinetics unlocks record efficiency in Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-025-01956-w</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Energy, Published online: 14 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-025-01956-w"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41560-025-01956-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Regulating hydrothermal reaction kinetics using sodium sulfide achieves a flattened valence band maximum across the Sb2(S,Se)3 film, lifting the potential barrier for hole transport while suppressing deep-level defect formation and reducing trap centres.

and Device Design with MACE MLIPs for CsSnX3 Perovskites</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mdsdz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Perovskite solar cell performance depends on the joint configuration of materials, interfaces, and
layer-specific physical parameters, forming a structured design space that is naturally sequential but
rarely modeled as such. This work introduces PervoTransformer, a transformer-based framework that
represents complete device architectures as sequences and learns device-level behavior directly from
this representation. A RoBERTa model is finetuned on SCAPS-generated device sequences spanning
six perovskite families, including MAPbI3, FAPbI3, CsPbI3, and their Sn-based analogs. The model
predicts multiple performance metrics simultaneously, including power conversion efficiency (PCE),
short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, and fill factor (FF), demonstrating that
transformer encoders can capture coupled, non-linear dependencies across the full device stack. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of transformer models to perovskite solar
cell device modeling using a sequence-based formulation. To explore device configurations beyond the
training distribution, a GPT-2 model is finetuned on the same device sequence formalism and used to
generate candidate architectures with novel combinations of compositional and physical parameters.
Generated sequences are screened for validity, uniqueness, and physical consistency using a retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) based constraint system. The validated devices are then passed back
through the finetuned RoBERTa model to predict performance metrics, enabling selection of high performing
candidates. Selected absorber configurations are further evaluated through device-level
simulations, forming an end-to-end loop for device prediction, generation, and screening. Additionally
machine-learned interatomic potentials based on the MACE framework are finetuned for CsSnX(X =
Cl,Br, I)3 using available DFT data, enabling efficient exploration of structural and energetic trends
in lead-free Sn perovskites and supporting absorber materials design. Together with the transformer based
predictive, generative, and screening workflow, this establishes a multi-scale strategy in which
sequence-aware transformers optimize device architectures while MLIPs guide atomic-scale materials
exploration for perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mdsdz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Revisiting the Robin–Day Classification through Switchable Electronic States in Multi-metallic Vanadium Oxides</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-83vzz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Polyoxovanadate–alkoxide clusters are redox-active molecular oxides offering profound electronic tunability. The oxygen-deficient species [(V₆O₅)(μ₆-O)(μ₂-OCH₃)₁₂] is an ideal platform for probing the multi-site localization and delocalization of redox states. Here, we introduce the redox topology modulation which is governed by the position of the central μ₆-O oxygen and ligand coordination at the oxygen-deficient site as the mechanism controlling the stability of different electromers. The non-coordinated cluster exhibits a localized, Robin-Day class I/II hybrid ground state, featuring a V(III) center at the vacancy defect. We demonstrate computationally that ligand-field tuning inverts this behavior; coordination of a strong donor destabilizes the localized topology, stabilizing an electromer with all V(IV) topology as the new ground state. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations show that photoexcitation of species where centers are V(IV) triggers photoinduced intervalence charge transfer regenerating a valence-trapped class II excited state. This work establishes the redox topology modulation as a rational design principle for molecular switches, where the fundamental electronic topology can be toggled by chemical stimulus and/or by light. Furthermore, our results suggest that the Robin–Day classification should be revised and extended for multi-center systems, where valence behavior is better understood as excitation-specific rather than molecular-specific.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-83vzz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Clarifying Stereochemical Outcomes in Radical-Initiated Vinyl Cyclopropane Cycloadditions within the Beckwith-Houk Framework</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-94d6n?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The (3+2) cycloaddition reaction is a widely utilized strategy in organic synthesis for constructing cyclopentane frameworks, a structural motif prevalent in many bioactive compounds and pharmaceutical applications. Over the past decades, numerous catalytic radical cascade reactions orchestrated by various types of open-shell catalysts have been reported. However, discrepancies in the relative configurations of cyclopentanes obtained using closely related methodologies suggest that some stereochemical misassignments may have occurred. In this work, discrepancies in some of the originally assigned trans configurations were uncovered through detailed stereochemical analyses employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of chemical shifts and coupling constants combined with 1D quantitative Nuclear Overhauser Effect (qNOE) NMR experiments. Notably, DFT predictions or the detection of NOESY correlations alone were insufficient in confidently assigning the relative configuration, accentuating the integration of experimental qNOE data with computational methods for accurate structural assignments. The data provided here demonstrates a general and robust approach for configurational verification of complex organic molecules with broader applicability beyond the radical (3+2) cycloaddition products discussed here.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-94d6n?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Enhanced conductance linearity in HfS 2 -based optoelectronic memristors via a defective h-BN interlayer for high-performance neuromorphic visual system</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/023305/3377390/Enhanced-conductance-linearity-in-HfS2-based</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Two-dimensional materials offer potential for developing optoelectronic memristors and neuromorphic visual systems, benefitting from their atomically smooth surfaces and tailorable optoelectronic characteristics.

Taking the prototypical 2D magnet CrI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as an example, we demonstrate the following issues: (i) the easy magnetization axis of anti-aligned bilayer CrI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits an inherent inclination, attributed to crystalline symmetry breaking as determined by interlayer shifts; and (ii) spontaneous sliding ferroelectricity emerges, wherein the reversal of polarization signifies a phase transition between energetically preferable states.

As a concrete implementation, we design a van der Waals heterostructure composed of metallic goldene and out-of-plane ferroelectric In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and construct 2D FTJs based on this heterostructure.

More importantly, the cooperative effect of polarization reversal and transport anisotropy induces four distinct resistance states that can be switched directly without an additional erase step. Our proposal provides a viable pathway for realizing nanoscale 2D FTJs with ultrahigh storage density and simplified multistate memory operation.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/023304/3377382/Giant-tunneling-electroresistance-and-multistate</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Ultrafast atomic dimerization of Peierls distortion in semimetal molybdenum ditelluride</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/021906/3377381/Ultrafast-atomic-dimerization-of-Peierls</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Semimetal molybdenum ditelluride (1T′-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) possesses diverse phase transitions, enriching its application prospects.

Abstract: Nanosized hafnia-zirconia HfxZr1-xO2 in the form of thin films, multilayers and heterostructures are indispensable silicon-compatible ferroelectric materials for advanced electronic memories and logic devices. The distinctive feature of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia are the critical sizes of ferroelectricity appearance, whereas the critical sizes of ferroelectricity disappearance exist in other ferroelectrics. Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, nonpolar and antipolar order parameters, we calculated analytically the strain-dependent critical sizes of the ferroelectricity appearance and disappearance, analyzed how the size effect and mismatch strains influence the phase diagrams and polarization switching barrier in epitaxial HfO2 thin films and nano-islands with the out-of-plane spontaneous polarization. We have shown that the critical thickness/height of out-of-plane spontaneous polarization disappearance is determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The critical thickness/height of the ferroelectricity appearance is determined by the size dependence of the effective mismatch strain considering possible appearance of misfit dislocations and lateral relaxion of strains. Derived analytical expressions can be generalized for HfxZr1-xO2 solid solutions, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06267v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Weakly spin-dependent band structures of antiferromagnetic perovskite LaMO$_3$ (M = Cr, Mn, Fe)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06422</link><description>arXiv:2601.06422v1 Announce Type: new

It is verified for these structures that there is a very simple rule to identify which wave number k exhibits spin splitting or degeneracy in the band structure. This rule uses the symmetry operations that map the up-spin atoms onto the down-spin atoms. The resulting spin splitting is very small for the most stable spin configuration of the most stable experimental structure. We discuss a plausible benefit of this characteristic, i.e., the direction-independence of the spin current, in electrode applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A phase field model of the effects of dislocation microstructure on grain boundary motion during recrystallization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06669</link><description>arXiv:2601.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal energy associated with the defect microstructure of strongly deformed crystals provides an important driving force for grain boundary motion during recrystallization. Typical dislocation microstructures are strongly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity affects the motion of recrystallization boundaries. In this study, a phase field model for microstructure evolution encompassing the evolution of both dislocation densities and grain order parameters is formulated. The model is employed to generate typical dislocation microstructures exhibiting multiscale features such as incidental and geometrically necessary dislocation walls. It is then used to study the motion of recrystallization boundaries in the associated complex defect energy 'landscape'.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are localized magnetic structures that retain their shape and stability over time, thanks to their topological nature. Recent theoretical and experimental progress has laid the groundwork for understanding magnetic skyrmions characterized by negligible net magnetization and ultrafast dynamics. Notably, skyrmions emerging in materials with altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase featuring lifted Kramers degeneracy-have remained unreported until now. In this study, we demonstrate that BiFeO3, a multiferroic renowned for its strong coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism, can transit from a spin cycloid to a Neel-type skyrmion under antidamping spin-orbit torque at room temperature. Strikingly, the altermagnetic spin splitting within BiFeO3 skyrmion can be reversed through the application of an electric field, revealed via the Circular photogalvanic effect. This quasiparticle, which possesses a neutral topological charge, holds substantial promise for diverse applications-most notably, enabling the development of unconventional computing systems with low power consumption and magnetoelectric controllability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nanoindentation induced plasticity in equiatomic MoTaW alloys by experimentally guided machine learning molecular dynamics simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06846</link><description>arXiv:2601.06846v1 Announce Type: new

A physics based similarity criterion, implemented via PCA of load-displacement curves, is used to identify mechanically representative experimental responses for quantitative comparison with simulations. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed yielding excellent agreement in the elastic regime between experiment and simulation, with reduced Young's moduli of approximately 270 GPa. Generalized stacking fault energy calculations reveal elevated unstable stacking- and twinning-fault energies in MoTaW relative to pure refractory elements, indicating suppressed localized shear and a preference for dislocation-mediated plasticity. Atomistic analyses demonstrate a strong crystallographic dependence of plastic deformation, with symmetric {110}&lt;111&gt; slip activation and four-fold rosette pile-ups for the [001] orientation, and anisotropic slip, strain localization, and enhanced junction formation for [011]. Local entropy and polyhedral template matching analyses further elucidate dislocation network evolution and deformation-induced local structural transformations. Overall, this study establishes a direct mechanistic link between fault energetics, orientation-dependent dislocation activity, and experimentally observed nanoindentation behavior in RCCA.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Size Dependent Ternary Halide Solid Solutions in Perovskite Nanocrystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06880</link><description>arXiv:2601.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline solid solutions incorporate guest atoms by substituting host lattice sites up to a solubility limit dictated by solute host similarity. Solid solutions enable tuning various material properties, such as the optoelectronic behavior of halide perovskites. In bulk, incompatibility of Cl:I halide mixtures restricts exploration throughout the ternary halide Cl:Br:I compositional range. However, solubility is extended in nanocrystals which better accommodate a wider range of ions within their lattice. Through high throughput synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of over 3000 samples, along with density functional theory and cluster expansion models, we determine the solubility boundaries of ternary halide perovskite nanocrystals and demonstrate their extended size dependent miscibility. Smaller nanocrystals, with sufficient Br content, stabilize the Cl:Br:I solid solutions, suppress planar stacking fault defects and prevent halide segregation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Driving Force Activated Phonon Scattering in InN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07207</link><description>arXiv:2601.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect related disorder during InN growth is a major challenge for making high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. This is partly because film quality is often described using reactor specific settings instead of general physical variables. In this study, we show that plasma assisted MOCVD growth of InN can be described using a single thermodynamic driving force coordinate. This coordinate brings together growth kinetics, defect sensitive Raman response and structural coherence across different process conditions. When we use this coordinate, the incorporation rate follows a universal activated trend with a kinetic scale of about 0.08 eV. Raman measurements show a clear crossover between a defect sparse and a defect rich regime, a disorder activated Raman metric increases quickly after the crossover, while an A1-LO control metric stays mostly the same. This suggests that short range lattice disorder, not long range polar coupling, dominates the defect activation process. X-ray diffraction shows that the out of plane coherence length stays the same for samples with the same driving force, even if reactor settings are very different. This supports the idea that structural coherence is organized by thermodynamics in this growth window. Finally, a simple kinetic Monte Carlo model using driving force biased incorporation and defect activation events matches the observed exponential trends and the two regimes, supporting the driving force approach. These results show that a transferable driving force coordinate can be used for plasma assisted InN growth and offer a quantitative way to achieve defect sparse growth conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Curvature-driven shifts of the Potts transition on spherical Fibonacci graphs: a graph-convolutional transfer-learning study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07346</link><description>arXiv:2601.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on spherical Fibonacci graphs. These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q&gt;4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reconfigurable Oxide Nanoelectronics by Tip-induced Electron Delocalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07494</link><description>arXiv:2601.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable oxide nanoelectronics, enabled by conductive atomic force microscope (cAFM) lithography, have established complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for quantum engineering that harnesses emergent phenomena for advanced functionalities. However, this cAFM nanofabrication process can only occur in the air, with simultaneous device decay described under the "water-cycle" writing mechanism. These restrictions pose ongoing challenges for device optimization in the quantum regime at mK temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a "waterless" cAFM lithography approach that is compatible with vacuum and cryogenic environments. Through oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we have achieved nonvolatile and reconfigurable cAFM control of nanoscale interfacial polaron-electron liquid transition at mK temperatures with an ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm. Supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling, we show that tip-controlled oxygen vacancy electromigration plays a key role. This advancement bridges reconfigurable device fabrication and concurrent characterization in situ at mK temperatures, and establishes a versatile Hubbard toolbox for engineering programmable quantum phases in correlated oxides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07494v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A density functional theory study of amino acids on Mg and Mg-based alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07680</link><description>arXiv:2601.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effects of random vacancies on the spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of silicene nanoribbon</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07717</link><description>arXiv:2601.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of silicene nanoribbon heterostructures are investigated, in which the central conductor contains a random distribution of vacancies and is connected to two pristine leads of the same material, placed in proximity to ferromagnetic insulators. The magnetic moments of the leads are analyzed in both parallel and antiparallel configurations. A tight-binding Hamiltonian and the Green's function formalism are employed to calculate the spin-resolved thermoelectric properties of the system as functions of geometrical confinement and vacancy concentration. The results demonstrate an enhancement in charge and spin-dependent thermopower, resulting in an improved thermoelectric efficiency at room temperature, which overcomes the limitations imposed by the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. These findings indicate that defective silicene nanoribbons are promising platforms for the development of efficient thermoelectric and spin-caloritronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Geometric theory of constrained Schr\"odinger dynamics with application to time-dependent density-functional theory on a finite lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07719</link><description>arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\"odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\"odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07719v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Geometric Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07724</link><description>arXiv:2601.07724v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A DFT study of B-doped graphene as a metal-anchor: effects of oxidation and strain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07770</link><description>arXiv:2601.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic DFT investigation of the interaction between B-doped graphene and four selected metals: Mg and Zn, relevant for next-generation metal-ion batteries, and Cu and Pt, important for single-atom catalysis. Three different boron doping concentrations were considered to elucidate how dopant density influences the binding strength, charge transfer, and electronic structure of the resulting systems. In addition, the effects of biaxial strain and surface oxidation were examined to assess their impact on the reactivity and stability of B-doped graphene. The results show that boron doping substantially enhances graphene's affinity toward metal adsorption, though the extent and nature of this effect depend strongly on the metal type and doping level. For some of the metals investigated, the interaction is found to be almost entirely charge-transfer driven, with minimal orbital hybridization. Mechanical strain is found to enable fine-tuning of the metal/substrate interaction, while surface oxidation introduces a more pronounced effect by enabling direct interaction between metal atoms and oxygen functional groups in most cases, thereby significantly altering adsorption geometry and strength. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of boron-doped graphene materials for energy conversion and storage applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Demonstrating Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture on Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16444</link><description>arXiv:2411.16444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.16444v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link><description>arXiv:2509.14762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14762v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11707</link><description>arXiv:2510.11707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11707v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovery of a new weberite-type antiferroelectric: La3NbO7</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04916</link><description>arXiv:2601.04916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are antipolar materials which possess an electric field-induced phase transition to a polar, ferroelectric phase and offer significant potential for sensing/actuation and energy-storage applications. Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04916v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vorticity-Crystalline Order Coupling in Supersolids: Excitations and Re-entrant Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05846</link><description>arXiv:2601.05846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, rather than the interparticle interactions, can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05846v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15622</link><description>arXiv:2508.15622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems: swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that these results stem from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15622v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Photochemical Birth of the Hydrated Electron in Liquid Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19702</link><description>arXiv:2508.19702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19702v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20785</link><description>arXiv:2512.20785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20785v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Quantum Chemical Insight into Electrochemical Upgrading of Bio-oil</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-02lvv?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels as an energy source and chemical feedstock. Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass yields a rich mixture of oxygenated organic species with low energy density and low stability, which can be electrochemically upgraded to increase energy density and stability and produce value-added chemicals. Here, we focus on electrocatalytic hydrotreatment of furfural (FF) and 4-propylphenol (4-PP), two constituents of raw bio-oil. In a binary mixture, the presence of FF has been shown to inhibit the reduction of 4-PP. The underlying mechanisms of these competing reactions are probed using density functional theory (DFT) and experimental electrochemical deposition techniques. The binding energies of FF and 4-PP, as well as their respective reduction products and associated reaction thermodynamics, are examined comparatively on multiple facets of single-crystal platinum and ruthenium catalysts. FF is shown to bind competitively compared to 4-PP, particularly on Pt(111) and Ru(0001), and hydrogenation products such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and 4-propylcyclohexanol (4-PCOL) were found to bind less strongly to the surfaces than the reactants. FF reduction side products, including dimers furoin (FUI) and hydrofuroin (HF), were also found to bind competitively with 4-PP. No thermodynamic barriers were observed for FF hydrogenation to THFA, whereas 4-PCOL formation is favored on Pt facets, and propylcyclohexane (PC) formation is favored on Ru. The presence of barriers to 4-PP hydrogenation indicates that FF hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored on Pt and Ru. Further, limiting potential calculations suggests that the FF reduction pathways are generally favorable around 0 V vs. RHE. In contrast, the 4-PP reduction pathways require a more cathodic bias, achieved at potentials less than -0.1 V vs. RHE. Adsorption behavior of FF-derived reduction products on polycrystalline Pt is experimentally validated using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). Such experiments yield estimates of aqueous-phase free energies of adsorption, which are correlated with the gas phase for comparison with computational results. Overall, the DFT model results suggest that the observed inhibition of 4-PP by FF is due to competitive adsorption and favorable FF reaction thermodynamics.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-02lvv?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Docking in Molecular Adsorbing Host-Guest Crystals</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-np9zk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Molecular Adsorbing Host-Guest (MAHG) crystals composed of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) macrocycles and tetraacid deriva-tives of diphenyl-viologen show diffusion of dihydroxybenzenes in the seemingly non-porous crystalline matrix resulting in highly colored single crystals. As in liquid phase, X-ray crystallography allowed us to show that electron-rich small molecules locate (after diffusion) in the macrocyclic hosts of the non-porous yet permeable crystals, facing the electron-poor viologen fragments to form colored charge transfer (CT) complexes. This phenomenon was confirmed by DFT, modelling the heteroternary complex. This combination of site-directed diffusion in the solid state and charge transfer formation results in rapid (minute timescale) detection of dihydroxybenzenes in aqueous solution by a crystalline material.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-np9zk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Anion Exchange in LaBaInO3F2: Structural and Optical Effects of Low-Temperature Topochemical Modification</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xnxv2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature topochemical modification of the Ruddlesden–Popper-type indium oxyfluoride LaBaInO3F2 using sodium hydride (NaH). By varying NaH equivalents, we monitored phase evolution, anion exchange, and reduction pathways using combined structural, spectroscopic, elemental and the density functional theory (DFT) analysis. LaBaInO3F2 undergoes controlled anion-extraction, with hydride-for-fluoride substitution produces mixed-anion oxy-fluoride-hydride phases, LaBaInO3F2−xHy, and NaF as a stable by-product. At moderate xNaH contents (x≤1), the RP-framework incorporates hydride with minimal decomposition, supported by re-oxidation experiments and DFT-calculated reaction enthalpies that confirm oxidizable hydride and subtle modification of the indium coordination environment. For xNaH&gt;1 result in the formation of secondary phases, indicating progressive lattice degradation. XPS indicates the possibility of subtle reduction of indium, with redox changes secondary to anion exchange. The executed study revealed a pathway how to stabilize hydride ions next to In3+, which is known to be notoriously hard otherwise. Optical spectroscopy reveals bandgap narrowing and enhanced visible-light absorption in hydride-rich samples, however, DFT estimates that idealized hydride substitution widens the bandgap, consistent with the experimentally non-ideal reduction with secondary phases. Overall, these findings establish hydride-based topochemical strategies as a promising route for controlled anion exchange with implications for photocatalytic and energy applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xnxv2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Herein, we demonstrate an eco-friendly synthesis of 3,3′-bisindolylalkane esters from α-keto carboxylic acids and indoles employing potassium hydrogen sulfate as a green promoter, with methanol acting as both reagent and solvent, in excellent yields. Beyond that, the methodology was further extended to the esterification of α-keto carboxylic acids and N-protected L-amino acid derivatives. Synthetic applications of the developed methodology were demonstrated in the concise total synthesis of Streptindole and Arsindoline B, a bioactive natural product. Complementary computational investigations, including SwissADME analyses, DFT, MEP, molecular docking, and MD simulations, demonstrated promising pharmacokinetic profiles, favourable electronic properties, and strong EGFR binding affinities, highlighting the potential of selected novel compounds as effective anticancer agents. Guided by these in silico predictions, experimental anticancer evaluation using in vitro MTT assays identified compound C26 as the most potent and selective derivative against A549 and T24 cancer cell lines, with reduced toxicity toward normal MCF-10a cells, underscoring its potential as a promising anticancer lead.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4k8v6-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Data-derived conceptual DFT nucleophilicity index</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dx9qc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The accurate characterisation of nucleophilicity has attracted the attention of research groups worldwide for many years. So far, no universally applicable descriptor that correlates closely with experimental observations has been established. In this study, the behaviour of the two conceptual DFT nucleophilicity indices is examined for a broad set of chemical compounds using semi-empirical methods. As exposed, the tested indices do not reliably capture experimental nucleophilicity trends when applied outside of small reference sets, leading to weak or negative correlations with Mayr's reactivity scale. To address these shortcomings, an empirical nucleophilicity index, $N_{emp}$, is constructed through symbolic regression, incorporating frontier orbital energies, CDFT-based reactivity descriptors, atom-specific Fukui functions, local charge information, and solvent characteristics. This model yields a markedly better correspondence with the experimental data, with additional improvements obtained for well-defined subsets of solvents and molecular scaffolds. Collectively, these findings expose the inherent limitations of existing global CDFT nucleophilicity indices and demonstrate the potential of data-driven strategies to build transferable reactivity descriptors.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dx9qc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] To Be or Not to Be: The Elusive Nature of Wheland-type Intermediates in Zeolite-Catalyzed Aromatic Alkylation Revealed by CCSD(T)-quality Metadynamics</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-2krfd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The sustainable utilization of biomass feedstocks to produce value-added chemicals is a central challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Cyclic alcohols constitute a major fraction of biomass-derived compounds, and their catalytic upgrading via zeolite-catalyzed alkylation provides an efficient route toward fuels and fine chemicals. In particular, benzene alkylation enables the synthesis of industrially relevant alkylated aromatics, while phenol alkylation is crucial for the valorization of lignin-derived feedstocks. Here, we employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) combined with well-tempered Metadynamics (WTMetaD) to investigate the alkylation of benzene and phenol using cyclohexene---the dehydrated form of cyclohexanol---as the alkylating agent within a zeolite framework. Free-energy surfaces (FES) obtained from enhanced sampling simulations are refined beyond standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT) using free-energy perturbation (FEP) to achieve MP2 and CCSD(T) accuracy. Our results reveal that it is essential to move beyond standard GGA-based DFT to accurately assess the stability of charged intermediates. The arenium ion (or Wheland intermediate), a key $\sigma$-complex in electrophilic aromatic substitution, appears relatively stable at the GGA level of theory.  However, higher-level CCSD(T) calculations show that it corresponds to only a weakly stabilized, shallow minimum, indicating a highly transient character. The presence of an activating group such as the hydroxyl substituent in phenol significantly stabilizes both the arenium intermediate and the corresponding transition state, thereby lowering the overall alkylation activation barrier.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-2krfd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] On-device cryogenic quenching enables robust amorphous tellurium for threshold switching</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68223-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 13 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68223-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68223-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Amorphous chalcogenide alloys are promising for Ovonic threshold switching selectors, yet elemental chalcogen based-material design is hindered by poor glass-forming ability of chalcogen species.

The approach is based on a formally exact, projection-based quantum embedding (PbE) technique that combines correlated many-electron wavefunction models for the molecular region with a Density Functional Theory (DFT) description of the metallic electrodes. This is achieved by constructing a specialized Hamiltonian for the molecular domain, leveraging Dyson orbitals corresponding to the ionized and electron-attached states of the embedded molecule. The effectiveness of this wavefunction-in-DFT (WFT-in-DFT) embedding scheme is demonstrated through transport calculations for SMJs containing benzene-1,4-diamine (BDA) and its substituted derivatives, employing Hartree–Fock, SOS-ADC(2), and CCSD methods for the molecular subsystem. The results show a marked improvement in the predicted zero-bias conductance compared to conventional DFT-based transport modeling employing the PBE functional. The proposed methodology provides a systematic way to select the most suitable electronic structure methods for the different parts of the system, maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational cost,  while ensuring a proper description of electronic correlation within the molecule, which may notably impact electron transport in certain systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r4vfs-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Long-term reliability of naturally aged hafnium oxide ferroelectric transistors for energy-efficient embedded memory</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00656-3?rss=yes</link><description>Senapati et al. report the first long-term reliability study of FeFETs aged naturally for more than 5 years.

The results demonstrate that the contact characteristics of ferroelectric heterostructures are jointly governed by the polarization of the ferroelectric layer and the work function of the metal layer. Specifically, when the polarization-induced electric field (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;pi&lt;/sub&gt;) and the built-in electric field (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt;) arising from charge transfer are oriented in the same directions, their interaction is enhanced; in contrast, when the two fields are aligned in opposite directions, this interaction is attenuated. Meanwhile, despite the presence of a strong Fermi level pinning effect, this pinning actually results in the formation of an Ohmic contact. Therefore, the results indicate that the In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X=Cl; F; O; OH) ferroelectric heterostructure has excellent properties and can provide theoretical guidance for experiments.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022108/3377313/Modulation-of-interfacial-Schottky-barrier-of</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] 214 MW/cm 2  vertical  β -Ga 2 O 3  UMOSFETs enabled by HF sidewall treatment</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022107/3377311/214-MW-cm2-vertical-Ga2O3-UMOSFETs-enabled-by-HF</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Vertical &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; U-shaped trench structures (UMOSFETs) incorporating current-blocking layers typically suffer from increased on-resistance, primarily caused by deep-level defect states in the trench sidewalls that trap free electrons. In this study, the hydrofluoric acid (HF) sidewall treatment was introduced prior to gate dielectric deposition to modify the trench surface. This process enables the effective incorporation of fluorine atoms into the sidewall region, increasing the electron concentration and mitigating the compensation associated with deep acceptor levels from heavy nitrogen implantation. As a result, the forward conduction is improved. In addition, the HF treatment partially passivates surface and interface traps and provides a mild polishing effect, which slightly reduces surface roughness. These changes help suppress interface scattering and further enhance carrier transport. The fabricated vertical &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; UMOSFETs achieved a specific on-resistance of 6.0 mΩ cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a channel mobility of 19.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V s, and a breakdown voltage of 1132 V.

This study systematically investigates how interface pinning influences the energy level landscape and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt; in poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (poly-TPD) diodes fabricated on SAM-modified NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; substrates. By tailoring the substrate work function (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Φ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;sub&lt;/sub&gt;) with SAMs, we achieve precise tuning over a wide range (4.3–5.7 eV). Combining electro-modulated absorption spectroscopy, Kelvin probe measurements, and numerical simulations, we find that pinning emerges in poly-TPD when &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Φ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;sub&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 4.7 eV and quantify how &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt; evolves in both pinned and unpinned regimes. The simulations reproduce the observed transition, which is triggered when &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Φ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;sub&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds a threshold of approximately 4.9 eV, corresponding to the hole-accepting level in poly-TPD with a state density of ∼2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Abstract: Rydberg excitons in $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$ simultaneously give rise to two very different optical responses under resonant two-photon excitation: a coherent second-harmonic signal mediated by the excitonic second order susceptibility tensor $\chi^{(2)}$, and a secondary emission originating from the radiative decay of real exciton populations. Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions. Our results provide a unified framework for interpreting emission from Rydberg excitons and offer guidelines for future studies aiming to exploit their nonlinear response and long-range interactions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05372v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The effect of normal stress on stacking fault energy in face-centered cubic metals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05453</link><description>arXiv:2601.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic deformation and fracture of FCC metals involve the formation of stable or unstable stacking faults (SFs) on (111) plane. Examples include dislocation cross-slip and dislocation nucleation at interfaces and near crack tips. The stress component normal to (111) plane can strongly affect the SF energy when the stress magnitude reaches several to tens of GPa. We conduct a series of DFT calculations of SF energies in six FCC metals: Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. The results show that normal compression significantly increases the stable and unstable SF energies in all six metals, while normal tension decreases them. The SF formation is accompanied by inelastic expansion in the normal direction. The DFT calculations are compared with predictions of several representative classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials. Many potentials fail to capture the correct stress effect on the SF energy, often predicting trends opposite to the DFT calculations. Possible ways to improve the ability of potentials to represent the stress effect on SF energy are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05453v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-Driven Unconventional Magnetoelectric Coupling in Perovskite Altermagnets: From Bulk to the Two-Dimensional Limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05602</link><description>arXiv:2601.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of altermagnets establishes a new paradigm for multiferroics. Unlike conventional multiferroics relying on direct magnetoelectric coupling, multiferroic altermagnets host a crystal-symmetry-mediated magnetoelectric interaction that is intrinsically more efficient and robust. Among candidate material platforms, layered perovskites are particularly appealing owing to their structural diversity and synthetic versatility. However, magnetoelectric properties at the two-dimensional scale remain largely unexplored, hindering their applicability in miniaturized, highly integrated devices. Here, we systematically investigate the dimensional evolution of ferroelectric polarization and magnetism in perovskite systems through symmetry analysis. We demonstrate that altermagnetism can persist in the two-dimensional limit, yet is strongly constrained by the magnetic configuration-with only C-type antiferromagnetic order supporting it. Based on mode-decomposition calculations, we further reveal that symmetry-restricted multimode couplings simultaneously govern ferroelectric polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. Finally, combined with first-principles calculations, we propose several strategies to lift the magnetic-configuration constraint, extending the range of viable altermagnetic systems. These results underscore the critical role of dimensionality in symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling in perovskite altermagnets and pave the way toward next-generation electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05602v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of Unconventional Ferroelectricity in Non-Moir'\e Graphene on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Boundaries and Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05621</link><description>arXiv:2601.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial interactions in two parallel-stacked hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) layers facilitate sliding ferroelectricity, enabling novel device functionalities. Additionally, when Bernal or twisted bilayer graphene is aligned with an hBN layer, unconventional ferroelectric behavior was observed, though its precise origin remains unclear. Here, we propose an alternative approach to engineering such an unconventional ferroelectricity in graphene-hBN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by creating specific types of hBN boundaries and interfaces. We found that the unconventional ferroelectricity can occur--without the alignments at graphene-hBN or hBN-hBN interfaces--when there are hBN edges or interfaces with line defects. By systematically analyzing the gate dependence of mobile and localized charges, we identified key characteristics of localized states that underlie the observed unconventional ferroelectricity, informing future studies. These findings highlight the complexity of the interfacial interactions in graphene/hBN systems, and demonstrate the potential for defect engineering in vdW heterostructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05621v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanical control of magnetic exchange and response in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: A computational study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05696</link><description>arXiv:2601.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic computational study of the effect of uniaxial strain on the magnetic properties of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric material known to host a field-induced skyrmion lattice (SkL). Using first-principles density functional theory, we first demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the exchange and anisotropy to specific structural distortions. These DFT-derived interactions are then integrated into a classical spin model to construct comprehensive magnetic phase diagrams under both compressive and tensile strain. Our key finding is that compressive strain ($\sim 2\%$) acts as an effective tuning parameter, substantially expanding the stability region of the $\vec Q_{100}$-driven topologically nontrivial phases. This results from the shifts in the critical magnetic fields and enhancement of the energy scale of the favored magnetic wave vector. In contrast, tensile strain induces a different magnetic ground-state by promoting a different magnetic ordering vector, $\vec Q_{110}$, leading to entirely distinct phase behavior. This work not only provides a quantitative understanding of the structural-magnetic coupling in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ but also establishes strain engineering as a powerful approach to control and optimize topologically non-trivial magnetic phases in centrosymmetric magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05696v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unraveling the effects of anionic vacancies and temperature on mechanical properties of NbC and NbN: Insights from Quantum Mechanical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05712</link><description>arXiv:2601.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal carbides and nitrides (TMCNs), such as niobium carbide (NbC) and niobium nitride (NbN), are of great technological interest due to their exceptional hardness, high melting points, and thermal stability. While previous studies have focused on their groundstate properties (at 0 K), limited information exists on their mechanical behavior under realistic operational conditions involving elevated temperatures and the presence of defects. In this study, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the effects of temperature (300 to 1500 K) and anionic vacancies on the mechanical properties of NbC and NbN in rocksalt (RS), zincblende (ZB), and wurtzite (WZ) structures. The results reveal a nonlinear decrease in elastic constants, bulk, shear, and Youngs moduli with both increasing temperature and defect concentration. Hardness and toughness analyses, based on Pughs ratio and Poisson ratio, show ductility and brittleness transitions that are sensitive to structure, defect level, and thermal effects. Furthermore, vacancy migration energies computed using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method demonstrate strong structural dependence, with RS exhibiting the highest barriers and WZ the lowest. These findings provide new insights into the defect and temperature interplay in NbC and NbN, offering guidelines for their optimization in high-temperature and wear-resistant applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vorticity-Crystalline Order Coupling in Supersolids: Excitations and Re-entrant Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05846</link><description>arXiv:2601.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, (rather than the interparticle interactions), can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-principles study of hydrogen diffusion in polycrystalline Nickel</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05917</link><description>arXiv:2601.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement in metals is strongly governed by hydrogen diffusion and trapping, yet predicting these effects in polycrystalline systems remains challenging. This work introduces a multiscale modeling framework that links atomistic energetics to continuum-scale transport. Migration barriers for bulk and grain-boundary environments, obtained from first-principles calculations, are used in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to compute anisotropic effective diffusivities. These diffusivities are then incorporated into finite element models of polycrystalline microstructures, explicitly accounting for grain-boundary character and connectivity. The approach captures both fast-path and trapping effects without relying on empirical parameters and reproduces experimental trends for nickel, including the dependence of effective diffusivity on grain size and boundary type. This methodology provides a physically grounded route for predicting hydrogen transport in engineering alloys and can be extended to other materials and defect types.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermally Configurable Multi-Order Polar Skyrmions in Multiferroic Oxide Superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05950</link><description>arXiv:2601.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar topological textures in low-dimensional ferroelectrics have emerged as a versatile platform for high-density information storage and neuromorphic computing. While low-order topological states, such as vortices and skyrmions, have been extensively studied, high-order polar topological families remain largely unexplored due to their higher energy requirements and limited stabilization methods. Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1{\pi}-, 2{\pi}-, 3{\pi}-, and 4{\pi}-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2{\pi}-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2{\pi}-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05950v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Operator-Algebraic Framework for Anyons and Defects in Quantum Spin Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05515</link><description>arXiv:2601.05515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we detail an operator algebraic approach to studying topological order in the infinite volume setting. We give a thorough and self-contained review of the DHR-style approach on quantum spin systems, which builds a category $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ of anyon sectors starting from microscopic lattice spin systems. In general, this category has the structure of a braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category. We will verify in full detail that $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ is the expected category in Kitaev's Quantum Double model, a paradigmatic model for studying topological order on the lattice. We will then extend the DHR-style analysis to systems in the presence of a global on-site symmetry, and introduce a category of symmetry defects, $G\mathsf{Sec}$, and show that it has the structure of a $G$-crossed braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] VacHopPy: A Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23467</link><description>arXiv:2503.23467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale modeling, which integrates material properties from ab initio calculations into continuum-scale simulations, is a promising strategy for optimizing semiconductor devices. However, a key challenge remains: while ab initio methods provide diffusion parameters specific to individual migration paths, continuum equations require a single effective set of parameters that captures the overall diffusion behavior. To address this issue, we present VacHopPy, an open-source Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics (MD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of hopping parameters, including hopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation factor, and attempt frequency, by statistically integrating energetic, kinetic, and geometric contributions across all paths. It also includes tools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions during MD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three representative materials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The extracted effective parameters reproduce temperature-dependent diffusion behavior and are in good agreement with previous experimental data. Provided in a simplified form, these parameters are well suited for continuum-scale models and remain valid over a wide temperature range spanning several hundred kelvins. Furthermore, VacHopPy inherently accounts for anisotropy in thermal vibrations, a factor often overlooked, making it suitable for simulating diffusion in complex crystals. Overall, VacHopPy establishes a robust bridge between atomic- and continuum-scale models, enabling more reliable multiscale simulation</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.23467v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Competing phases and domain structures of ferroelectric perovskites: the benefit of epitaxial (110) growth</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02118</link><description>arXiv:2601.02118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain and domain engineering offer powerful routes to control phase and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films. While most studies have focused on (100)-oriented growth, the impact of lower-symmetry orientations remains underexplored. We address this gap in knowledge with first-principles based molecular dynamics simulation for the example of prototypical ferroelectric perovskites under (110) strain. Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02118v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Predicting Enantioselectivity via Kinetic Simulations on Gigantic Reaction Path Networks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d6slj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Asymmetric catalysts exert control over the reactivity and enantioselectivity of chemical reactions, often through their large size and highly flexible geometries. Current quantum chemical calculations provide a powerful means to predict enantioselectivity through exhaustive conformational sampling at the selectivity-determining transition state (TS). However, this approach still relies on a predetermined selectivity-determining step and on the assumption that selectivity is governed by the Boltzmann distribution of TS conformers. To address this issue, constructing a reaction path network that captures the kinetically accessible regions of the potential energy surface is essential. In this study, we applied a delta-learning neural network potential (ΔNNP) to an asymmetric organocatalyst belonging to the imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPi) family, comprising over 200 atoms. The ΔNNP demonstrated accuracy comparable to that of density functional theory (DFT) using GFN2-xTB as the baseline method and learning the DFT–GFN2-xTB energy differences through the neural network model. Using the ΔNNP-based single component - artificial force induced reaction (denoted by NNP/AFIR) method, we constructed a reaction path network containing 48463 paths. Kinetic simulations based on this network were then performed to predict the reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity. Within the network, neumerous paths, including asynchronous concerted and stepwise mechanisms, were found to be energetically competitive and thus to contribute to the overall kinetics. Traffic volume analysis further revealed that intermediates with negligible yields can still play important kinetic roles. Overall, the NNP/AFIR approach would provide a powerful framework not only for deepening mechanistic understanding but also for accelerating the rational design of asymmetric catalytic systems with high reactivity and enantioselectivity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d6slj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Insights to orientation dependence of molecular

that while the wavefunction-in-DFT, SOS-ADC(2)-in-PBE method provides the most
balanced description of both mean conductance and histogram width, no method fully
captures the behavior of the more rigid dithienophosphole system, likely due to limitations
of the underlying structural sampling. These findings highlight the importance of
realistic configurational sampling and demonstrate that conductance histograms offer
a sensitive benchmark for evaluating theoretical transport methodologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-vg0hm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Probing Molecular Organization in Polar Nematic Phases: A Combined FTIR Spectroscopy and Molecular Simulation Approach</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9bf98-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However,
the relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting
macroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using
a combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S ≈ 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase. This study demonstrates that the unique properties of polar nematics are governed by specific molecular self-assembly and establishes phase biaxiality as a key feature
of these systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9bf98-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Copper Ligation and Nuclearity Dictate the Solution Dynamics and Hydrogen Evolution Activity of Discrete Mo–Cu Sulfide Clusters</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9135r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Heterobimetallic clusters comprising Group 6 thiometallates and earth-abundant transition metals are of significant interest for applications in laser technology, telecommunications, sensing, and catalysis. An advantage of clusters relative to the bulk-state materials is their tunable architecture, which enables precise modulation of physicochemical properties and reactivity through ligand and core structure manipulation. Recently, we reported the Mo–Cu cluster [Tp*MoS3(CuSPh)2]– ([1•(CuSPh)2]–; Tp* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate) as a discrete model of layered Cu2MoS4 and functional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via a sulfur-centered pathway. While the Tp* ligand was found to be essential for stabilizing the clusters and precluding the formation of reactive Mo-hydrides, the impact of copper ligation and nuclearity remained uncertain. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a series of derivatives, [1•(CuX)n]– and [1•(CuL)n]1–n, systematically varying the ancillary X- and L-type copper ligands. Single crystal XRD and 1H DOSY NMR analyses reveal that while nuclearities of n = 2-4 are accessible in the solid state, the higher-order clusters (n = 3, 4) exhibit significant solution-state lability. Electrocatalytic evaluations show that the new clusters are markedly less active for the HER than the thiophenolate parent. DFT calculations attribute this difference to the attenuated sulfur basicity and (in some cases) weaker S–H bonds that result from increased copper nuclearity, ancillary ligand donicity, or overall charge. Collectively, this work reveals that while copper ligation and nuclearity offer a modular approach to tuning HER thermochemistry, these changes also impact the cluster’s ability to maintain structural integrity under catalytic conditions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9135r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Surprisingly, both ligand classes have rarely been employed together in Rh complexes. In order to get more detailed insight into the interaction between NHC and diene ligand simulta-neously coordinated to the same Rh center, a series of eight neutral Rh diene NHC complexes, [Rh(L1)(NHC)Cl] (NHC = ICy, IMes, IiPr, IPr, SIPr, IMe, (R)-IEtPh, (S)-IEtPh), and four cati-onic analogues, [Rh(L1)(NHC)]X (NHC = ICy, IMes, IPr: X = B(ArF)4; R = ICy: X = SbF6) were synthesized from the known precursor [Rh(L1)Cl] by three complementary synthetic routes and following anion exchange. X-Ray crystal structure analyses revealed pronounced NHC-dependent distortions from square-planar geometry in the neutral complexes, whereas the cationic species remain comparatively rigid. Catalytic studies showed a strong dependence on the identity of the NHC ligand: while NHC incorporation generally reduced yields and enantioselectivities in asym-metric 1,2- and 1,4-additions, the cationic complex [Rh(L1)(ICy)]SbF6 delivered markedly im-proved activity and selectivity in 1,6-enyne cycloisomerization, consistent with reduced catalyst deactivation as confirmed by kinetic analysis. DFT calculations identified a concerted ring-closure as the rate-determining step and showed that stereocontrol originates from key interactions en-forced by the chiral diene scaffold, which are disrupted by bulkier NHC ligands. Overall, these findings highlight the decisive influence of NHC sterics on the structure, stability, and asymmetric reactivity of Rh diene catalysts.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-s58zm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] In Situ Li Seed Formation Enables Uniform Plating in Anode-Free Solid-State Batteries</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b2t7f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Anode-free solid-state batteries (AFSSBs) are a promising route toward achieving high energy density. In these cells, the anode contains no pre-stored lithium (Li). Instead, all Li inventory originates from the cathode and is freshly deposited onto a bare current collector during charging. However, achieving uniform and defect-free Li plating on this bare current collector remains a major challenging, often resulting in low Li plating/stripping efficiency and rapid capacity decay. Here, for the first time, operando neutron imaging is employed to visualize Li plating/stripping behavior in an anode-free full cell with LiNi0.82Mn0.07Co0.11O2 (NMC) as the cathode. Operando measurements reveal that complete stripping of Li leaves isolated Li residues on the current collector, which degrades interfacial contact between the current collector and solid-state electrolyte. To mitigate this interfacial issue and promote more uniform Li deposition, we implement a discharge cutoff voltage strategy that intentionally retains a thin residual Li layer after stripping. This thin Li layer, serving as an in situ–formed seed layer, not only enables more homogeneous subsequent Li plating but also improves interfacial contact. As a result, the anode-free cell with a controlled discharge voltage of 3.5 V exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability, maintaining a discharge capacity of 116 mAh g-1 with a retention rate of 83.4% and an average Coulombic efficiency of approximately 99.9% after 430 cycles at 0.25 C. In contrast, the cell with a conventional discharge cutoff voltage of 2.8 V exhibits rapid capacity decay, retaining only 59.7 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles with a capacity retention of 40.7%. This work offers a practical strategy to unlock the long-term viability of anode-free solid-state batteries.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b2t7f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Atomistic nonequilibrium Green's function study of radiation-induced charge loss in floating gate flash memories</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/023503/3377172/Atomistic-nonequilibrium-Green-s-function-study-of</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;This study presents an atomistic nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach for modeling radiation-induced charge loss in floating-gate flash memories, which become increasingly vulnerable to radiation effects as device features shrink. Nonradiative charge-carrier recombination at localized deep-level defect centers is treated by coupling the defect Green's function to delocalized interface states derived from a two-probe tight-binding description, via multiphonon-scattering self-energies. Using oxygen vacancies as representative deep-level traps, the trap-assisted tunneling current under retention conditions is calculated by integrating the NEGF formalism within a drift-diffusion solver. This NEGF framework significantly improves agreement with experimental data from heavy-ion irradiation, and provides insights beyond semiclassical models. These findings underscore the necessity of atomistic, fully quantum treatments for reliable assessment and design of radiation-hardened nonvolatile memory technologies.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/023503/3377172/Atomistic-nonequilibrium-Green-s-function-study-of</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] A low-cost green mixed antisolvent strategy for strain-release and defect-reduction toward efficient perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/023901/3377167/A-low-cost-green-mixed-antisolvent-strategy-for</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Antisolvent engineering is among the most widely used techniques for fabricating high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Recent mixed antisolvent strategies have shown great promise for enhancing the performance of PSCs. These approaches tailor the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films by utilizing solvents with complementary physicochemical properties. In this work, we develop a low-cost and environmentally benign mixed antisolvent system employing ethanol (EtOH) and tert-butanol (TBA). Remarkably, the content of only 5 vol. % TBA in the antisolvent mixture leads to a substantial efficiency improvement, elevating the power conversion efficiency from 21.8% (pure EtOH) to 24.1%, while also significantly enhancing device stability. Further analysis indicates that TBA incorporation effectively mitigates perovskite bulk lattice strain and facilitates pinhole-free grain growth, resulting in enhanced charge carrier mobility and suppressed non-radiative recombination. Our study highlights a simple, cost-effective, and green mixed antisolvent strategy for advancing high-performance PSCs toward practical photovoltaic applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/023901/3377167/A-low-cost-green-mixed-antisolvent-strategy-for</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Controllable intrinsic defect-induced electronic structure modulation in few-layer pentagonal PdPS</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/021901/3377165/Controllable-intrinsic-defect-induced-electronic</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with a unique Cairo pentagonal lattice, shows great potential for optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications. However, its electronic transport behavior is strongly influenced by intrinsic defects. In this work, we systematically investigate the formation mechanisms and electronic consequences of intrinsic point defects in few-layer PdPS using first-principles calculations. We evaluate the formation energies of sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and palladium (Pd) vacancies, as well as the interstitial Pd atoms and reveal their impacts on the electronic band structure. Unlike common 2D semiconductors like MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PdPS hosts more low-energy defect configurations, which lead to bandgap narrowing, in-gap states as well as a Fermi level shift toward the conduction band. To validate the theoretical predictions, scanning tunneling microscopy measurements were performed, revealing the distinct defect morphologies and confirming the emergence of in-gap states under controlled annealing conditions. Complementary electrical transport measurements reveal a significantly reduced Schottky barrier height and significantly improved electron transport properties, attributed to the defect-induced electronic structure modulation. These results provide atomic-scale insights into the defect-driven phenomena in 2D PdPS, offering a pathway for tailoring electronic properties via defect engineering for future field-effect transistor applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/021901/3377165/Controllable-intrinsic-defect-induced-electronic</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Cu 2+ -facilitated formation of Mn 2+ –Mn 2+  dimers inducing redshift of Mn 2+  emission in Co-doped perovskite nanocrystals</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/021902/3377160/Cu2-facilitated-formation-of-Mn2-Mn2-dimers</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Transition metal doping in perovskite nanocrystals is an important means to regulate their photophysical properties. In particular, the underlying concentration effect and optical process deserve further study. Herein, we investigate the phenomenon of continuous redshift in manganese-doped perovskite nanocrystals' spectra with the Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; doping concentration. The results from experiment combined with density functional theory show that the spectral redshift primarily results from the heightened emission of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;–Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dimers and the reduced contribution of isolated Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as the concentration of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increases.

In addition, complex phenomena such as singlet-triplet conversion, carrier recombination, and the existence of impurities and defects contribute to complex spin relaxation mechanisms.

When using the state-of-the-art anion exchange membranes, ammonia crossover from the cathode to the anode, can cause rapid decay in DAFC performance as the current density increases. Mixed metal oxides containing manganese-nickel-cobalt have emerged as NH₃ tolerant cathode catalysts but their systematic testing under variable loading conditions in DAFC is rarely reported. Here, we examine low-temperature DAFCs with electrodeposited platinum (Pt), manganese-cobalt (MnCo), and manganese-nickel-cobalt (MnNiCo) cathodes on Ni foam. To isolate cathodic effects, all cells use identical Pt on Ni Foam anodes with alkaline ammonia feeds. Structural characterization confirms defect-rich spinel coatings. MnCo achieves oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance comparable to Pt, sustaining higher load voltage with lower interfacial resistance and larger capacitance, while MnNiCo shows restricted performance and rapid voltage loss, indicating sluggish charge transfer and fewer active sites. These results identify electrodeposited MnCo on Ni foam as a promising, scalable PGM-free cathode for DAFCs and highlight compositional and mesostructural tuning as key levers to improve catalytic activity and device performance.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-x7fdh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Ultrahigh energy storage density and efficiency in AgNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based ceramics by percolating interaction between antipolar regions and defect pairs</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68297-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 10 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68297-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68297-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A percolating interaction between antipolar regions and engineered defect pairs facilitates antipolar rotations, enabling superior energy storage performance in AgNbO3-based ceramics.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68297-4</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Little is known about oxygen-related defects in diamond. Recently, the promising room-temperature spin centre named ST1 was identified as an oxygen centre, but of still unknown atomic structure and thermal stability. In this work, we report on the optically active oxygen-related centres and the conditions for their formation, using ion implantation of oxygen in various conditions of depth and fluence. More specifically, we establish the temperature formation/stability range of the ST1 centre, which has a maximum at about 1100{\deg}C and is narrower than for NV centres. In these conditions, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on small ST1 ensembles was measured with a spin readout contrast of &gt; 20% at 300K. In cathodoluminescence, the 535 nm ST1 peak is not observed. Besides, a broad peak centred at 460 nm is measured for implantation of O$_2$ molecular ions. For an annealing temperature of 1500{\deg}C, a different centre is formed (with ZPL at 584.5 nm) with an intensity increasing with a power law 1.5 &lt; p &lt; 1.9 dependence from the implantation fluence. This suggests that this centre contains two oxygen atoms. Besides, a new spectral feature associated to an intrinsic defect was also observed, with four prominent lines (especially at 594nm). Finally, the thermal formation and stability of oxygen centres in diamond presented here are important for the identification of the atomic structure of defects such as the ST1 and possible O$_2$V$_x$ complex by means of ab initio calculations. Indeed, the formation energies and charge states of defect centres are easier to compute than the full energy level scheme, which to date still remains unsuccessful regarding the ST1 centre.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anisotropic magnon transport in an antiferromagnetic trilayer heterostructure: is BiFeO$_3$ an altermagnet?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04578</link><description>arXiv:2601.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons provide a route to ultra-fast transport and non-destructive readout of spin-based information transfer. Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet. This work provides an understanding of the anisotropic spin transport in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist, paving the way for a new route to realize electric-field control of a novel state of magnetism.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04578v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How semiconducting are ferroelectrics: The fundamental, optical and transport gaps of Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-BaTiO$_3$ and NaNbO$_{3}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04721</link><description>arXiv:2601.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy gap is a fundamental property of materials, directly related to their optical and electronic properties. The energy gap of ferroelectric compounds and its adjustment by compositional variation has particularly attracted attention in recent years due to potential application in energy conversion and/or catalytic devices. It is demonstrated that it is necessary to distinguish between the fundamental gap, $E_{\rm g}^{0}$, the optical gap, $E_{\rm g}^{\rm opt}$, and the transport gap, $E_{\rm g}^{\rm tr}$, of ferroelectrics, which can differ significantly. The situation is comparable to those in organic semiconductors and emerges from the presence of localized charges. The fundamental gap is a ground state property, i.e.\ the energy difference between the maximum of the fully occupied valence band and the minimum of the completely empty conduction band. In contrast, the optical and transport gaps are excited state properties involving localized (polaronic) electrons and/or holes at energies considerably different from the band edges. This work illustrates how the different energy gaps of ferroelectrics can be determined by combining optical measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature and oxygen partial pressure dependent electrical conductivity measurements. We determine fundamental gaps of $\approx 4.5\,$eV for both materials, optical gaps of $3.25-3.45\,$eV/$3.5\,$eV and electrical gaps of $\approx 1.4\,$eV/$3.3\,$eV for Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-BaTiO$_3$/NaNbO$_{3}$, respectively.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards understanding the defect properties in the multivalent A-site Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-based perovskite ceramics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04725</link><description>arXiv:2601.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defect model involving cation and anion vacancies and anti-site defects is proposed that accounts for the non-stoichiometry of multi-valent $A$-site Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ based perovskite oxides with $ABO_3$ composition. A series of samples with varying $A$-site non-stoichiometry and $A$:$B$ ratios were prepared to investigate their electrical conductivity. The oxygen partial pressure and temperature dependent conductivities where studied with direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) techniques, enabling to separate between ionic and electronic conduction. The Na-excess samples, regardless of the $A$:$B$ ratio, exhibit dominant ionic conductivity and $p$-type electronic conduction, with the highest total conductivity reaching $4 \times 10^{-4}$ S/cm at 450$^\circ$C. In contrast, the Bi-excess samples display more insulating characteristics and $n$-type electronic conductivity, with conductivity values within the 10$^{-8}$ S/cm range at 450$^\circ$C. These conductivity results strongly support the proposed defect model, which offers a straightforward description of defect chemistry in NBT-based ceramics and serves as a valuable guide for optimizing sample processing to achieve tailored properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing quantum critical crossover via impurity renormalization group</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04729</link><description>arXiv:2601.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanisms of Spatiotemporal Damage Evolution in Double Polymer Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04759</link><description>arXiv:2601.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double polymer networks exhibit a striking enhancement of toughness compared to single networks, yet the microscopic mechanisms governing stress redistribution, damage evolution, and fracture remain incompletely understood. Using large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial deformation, we resolve bond scission statistics, local stress redistribution following individual bond-breaking events, and the spatiotemporal evolution of damage in single- and double-network architectures. We show that while the early mechanical response is dominated by the pre-stretched sacrificial network, damage evolution in double networks follows a qualitatively distinct pathway. In contrast to single networks, where anisotropic stress redistribution promotes rapid localization and catastrophic fracture, the presence of a soft matrix in double networks induces a screening of stress redistribution generated by sacrificial bond scission. This screening suppresses correlated rupture events and stabilizes multiple damage zones, leading to a strongly delocalized damage landscape over a broad deformation range. At larger strains, when the matrix becomes load-bearing, damage progressively localizes, ultimately triggering fracture. By isolating the dynamics of individual damage zones, we further demonstrate that matrix-mediated stress screening stabilizes defects and delays localization. Together, these results identify stress-screening-induced damage delocalization as a central microscopic mechanism underlying toughness enhancement in multiple-network elastomers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04759v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lateral Graphene-Metallene Interfaces at the Nanoscale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04838</link><description>arXiv:2601.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallenes are atomically thin, nonlayered two-dimensional materials. While they have appealing properties, their isotropic metallic bonding makes their stabilization difficult and presents considerable challenges to their synthesis and practical applications. However, their stabilization can still be achieved by suspending them in the pores of two-dimensional template materials, making the properties of lateral interfaces of metallenes scientifically relevant. Here, we combined density-functional theory and universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to study lateral interfaces between graphene and 45 metallenes with various profiles. We optimized the interfaces and analyzed their energies, electronic structures, and stabilities at room temperature, defect formations, and structural deformations. While broad trends were identified using machine-learning analysis of all interfaces, density-functional theory was the main tool for studying the microscopic properties of selected elements. We found that the interfaces are the most stable energetically and with respect to lattice mismatch, defect formation, and lateral strain when their profiles were geometrically smooth. The most stable interfaces are found for transition metals. In addition, we demonstrate how universal machine-learning interatomic potentials now offer the accuracy required for the modeling of graphene-metallene interfaces. By systematically expanding the understanding of metallenes' interface properties, we hope these results guide and accelerate their synthesis to enable future applications and benefit from metallenes' appealing properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Triple-well ferroelectricity and kagome-like Chern flat band in two-dimensional multiferroic CuVP$_2$Se$_6$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04846</link><description>arXiv:2601.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics that host nontrivial topological bands offer a rich platform for correlated and tunable quantum phenomena, yet such materials remain rare. Here, using first-principles calculations, we reveal that monolayer CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ unites a tunable triple-well ferroelectric transition with a spin-polarized Chern flat band. The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane. These findings establish CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ as a promising candidate for exploring electrically tunable flat-band correlations and topological magnetism in a multiferroic monolayer.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovery of a new weberite-type antiferroelectric: La3NbO7</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04916</link><description>arXiv:2601.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are antipolar materials which possess an electric field-induced phase transition to a polar, ferroelectric phase and offer significant potential for sensing/actuation and energy-storage applications. Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04916v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exploring the Potential of Two-dimensional Borospherene for Toxic Gas Sensing and Capture: A DFT Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04935</link><description>arXiv:2601.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) boron-based materials have gained increasing interest due to their exceptional physicochemical properties and potential technological applications. In this way, borospherenes, a 2D Boron-based fullerene-like lattice (2D-B40), are explored due to their potential for capturing and detecting toxic gases, such as CO, NO, NH3, and SO2. Therefore, density functional theory simulations were carried out to explore the adsorption energy and the distinct interaction regimes, where CO exhibits weak physisorption (-0.16 eV), while NO (-2.24 eV), NH3 (-1.47 eV), and SO2 (-1.51 eV) undergo strong chemisorption. Bader charge analysis reveals significant electron donation from 2D-B40 to NO and electron acceptance from SO2. These interactions cause measurable shifts in work function, with SO2 producing the most significant modulation (14.6%). Remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) reveal spontaneous SO2 decomposition at room temperature, indicating dual functionality for both sensing and environmental remediation. Compared to other boron-based materials, such as chi3-borophene, beta12-borophene, and B40 fullerene, 2D-B40 exhibits superior gas affinity, positioning it as a versatile platform for the detection and capture of toxic gases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04935v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Crystal Structure Prediction of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks Using DFT and Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05097</link><description>arXiv:2601.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is emerging as a powerful method for the computational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this article we demonstrate the high-throughput exploration of the crystal energy landscape of zinc imidazolate (ZnIm2), a highly polymorphic member of the zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF) family, with at least 24 reported structural and topological forms, with new polymorphs still being regularly discovered. With the aid of custom-trained machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) we have performed a high-throughput sampling of over 3 million randomly-generated crystal packing arrangements and identified 9626 energy minima characterized by 1493 network topologies, including 864 topologies that have not been reported before. Comparisons with previously reported structures revealed 13 topological matches to the experimentally-observed structures of ZnIm2, demonstrating the power of the CSP method in sampling experimentally-relevant ZIF structures. Finally, through a combination of topological analysis, density and porosity considerations, we have identified a set of structures representing promising targets for future experimental screening. Finally, we demonstrate how CSP can be used to assist in the identification of the products of the mechanochemical synthesis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanics of axis formation in $\textit{Hydra}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05220</link><description>arXiv:2601.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of a body axis is a fundamental step in the development of multicellular organisms. In simple systems such as $\textit{Hydra}$, growing evidence suggests that mechanical forces generated by collective cellular activity play a central role in this process. Here, we explore a physical mechanism for axis formation based on the coupling between active stresses and tissue elasticity. We analyse the elastic deformation induced by activity-generated stresses and show that, owing to the spherical topology of the tissue, forces globally condense toward configurations in which both elastic strain and nematic defect localise at opposite poles. These mechanically selected states define either a polar or apolar head-food axis. To characterize the condensed regime, we introduce a compact parametrization of of the active force and flux distributions, enabling analytical predictions and direct comparison with experiments. Using this framework, we calculate experimentally relevant observables, including areal strain, lateral pressure, and normal displacements during muscular contraction, as well as the detailed structure of topological defect complexes in head and foot regions. Together, our results identify a mechanical route by which active tissues can spontaneously break symmetry at the organismal scale, suggesting a general physical principle underlying body-axis specification during morphogenesis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How many-body chaos emerges in the presence of quasiparticles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05238</link><description>arXiv:2601.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body chaos is a default property of many-body systems; at the same time, near-integrable behaviour due to weakly interacting quasiparticles is ubiquitous throughout condensed matter at low temperature. There must therefore be a, possibly generic, crossover between these very different regimes. Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Creation and Microscopic Origins of Single-Photon Emitters in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19815</link><description>arXiv:2504.19815v4 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Understanding the moisture stability of oxide Li-ion conductors is important for their practical applications in solid-state batteries. Unlike sulfide or halide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in contact with water, but can still undergo topotactic \ch{Li+}/\ch{H+} exchange (LHX). Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning interatomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of the LHX reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor families: garnets and NASICONs. Li-stuffed garnets exhibit a strong driving force for proton exchange due to their high Li chemical potential. In contrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange due to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond covalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: Li stuffing enhances conductivity but increases moisture susceptibility. This study underscores the importance of designing Li-ion conductors that possess both high conductivity and high stability in practical environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.13477v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect configuration of an active nematic around a circular obstacle</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20069</link><description>arXiv:2510.20069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. In this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. In the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. In the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. We first perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. Furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. Our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. Our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.20069v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link><description>arXiv:2601.00744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00744v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temporal coherence of single photons emitted by hexagonal Boron Nitride defects at room temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10644</link><description>arXiv:2505.10644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.10644v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] DynaSpec: Metadynamics and Raman Spectroscopy for Glycan Structure–Spectrum Mapping</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-s42n5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Raman spectroscopy offers label-free access to molecular vibrations across biological systems of varying complexities, from small molecules to flexible biomolecular oligomers and even whole cells. While Raman spectra of small molecules often permit direct structural interpretation, intermediate-sized systems—such as glycans, short nucleic acids, and peptides—exhibit higher compositional and conformational heterogeneity that obscures structure–spectrum relationships. We introduce DynaSpec, a framework integrating metadynamics performed in a machine-learned latent space with population-weighted DFT Raman calculations and experimental Raman spectroscopy to enable quantitative, bidirectional mapping between molecular structure and vibrational spectra. By determining equilibrium conformational populations and linking normal modes to the structural coordinates that modulate them, DynaSpec enables mechanistic interpretation of congested Raman profiles. Applied to glycans, DynaSpec’s ensemble-averaged DFT predictions agree with experimentally acquired spectra that support &gt;85% classification accuracy across 13 N-glycans. Metadynamics reveals a conserved α6 open–curled switching motif, and the combined analysis identifies a glycosidic torsion-enriched window that enables experimental positional isomer discrimination to &gt;70% accuracy. DynaSpec also generalizes to O-glycans and sulfated glycosaminoglycans.

Reference data were obtained using the high-level coupled-cluster CC3 model in combination with the aug-cc-pVTZ atomic basis set, providing the first systematic dataset of e0xcited-state polarizabilities at this level of theory. The studied set includes both valence and Rydberg states, the latter  exhibiting significantly larger polarizabilities, reflecting their diffuse character and enhanced sensitivity to external electric fields. The benchmark analysis includes lower-order wavefunction-based methods, namely CCSD and CC2, as well as Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with several common density functional approximations (B3LYP, MN15, M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and LC-BLYP). The statistical analysis enables the evaluation of the impact of orbital relaxation and highlights method-dependent differences across the different kind of excited states, as well as according to the different chemical character of molecules. The results indicate that CCSD, both in its relaxed and unrelaxed forms, provides the most accurate description of excited-state polarizabilities, closely followed by CC2, which can therefore be generally employed as a computationally efficient yet reliable alternative.

In this work, a comprehensive density functional theory investigation is carried out to explore the influence of semi-metal doping and edge configuration on the structural, electronic, chemical reactivity, and optical properties of hexagonal graphene quantum dots. Two edge types, zigzag and armchair, are considered for pristine GQDs and GQDs doped with fourth group (Si, Ge) and fifth group elements (As, Sb). All geometries are fully optimized using the CAM-B3LYP and ωB97XD functionals via DFT, and the electronic excitations are analyzed via time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The results exhibit that heteroatom doping induces significant structural distortion due to the larger covalent radii of dopants and their specific valence shell electron configuration compared to carbon. Electronic structure analysis shows that both dopant type and edge configuration strongly modulate the HOMO–LUMO gap and density of states. In particular, doping the GQDs with fourth group elements —especially with zigzag edges—exhibit a pronounced reduction in bandgap, chemical hardness, and an enhancement in dipole moment and electrophilicity index, indicating improved charge-transfer capability and electronic reactivity. In contrast, arsenic- and antimony-doped systems introduce more localized electronic states, higher electrophilicity, and increased structural strain, because of their different valence shell electron configuration compared with carbon, suggesting carrier trapping tendencies that are less favorable for electronic transport applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-lfj6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Ferroelectric and ferroionic multifunctional quantum sensors: Incursion into applications</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011306/3377141/Ferroelectric-and-ferroionic-multifunctional</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Ferroelectric materials are poised to drive the next technological leap through their emergent functionalities, including negative capacitance and resistance, charge accumulation without transport, and spontaneous polarization switching. The discovery of ferroionic material-systems that combine room-temperature ferroelectricity and fast ionic conductivity has opened an unprecedented avenue for multifunctional devices that merge the territories of electronics and ionics. These hybrid materials enable the direct coupling of ionic and electronic order parameters, allowing long-range electrostatic interactions, wireless field communication, and energy transduction across solid–solid and solid–air interfaces. Such capabilities offer potential solutions to long-standing challenges, including the Boltzmann limit in transistor subthreshold operation, voltage amplification without power dissipation, and nonvolatile polarization states with ionic reconfigurability. Beyond conventional applications, ferroionics support a new generation of quantum sensors and adaptive devices, spanning optical, electrical, mechanical, thermal, and magnetic domains. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the conceptual foundations, theoretical frameworks, and experimental progress underlying ferroionic systems, highlighting their role as a bridge between ferroelectrics, solid electrolytes, and correlated quantum materials.

Abstract: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been reported in a wide range of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The interplay between topology, defects and chiral order in the nearly-commensurate charge density wave of 1T-TaS2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03379</link><description>arXiv:2601.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1T-TaS2, the nearly-commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) exhibits emergent chirality, a property of interest for technological applications such as memory. We study the relationship between chirality and topological defects using holographic analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy data. By characterizing the CDW order parameter, we uncover distinct topological defects and define a chiral order parameter that connects directly to them. Our analysis distinguishes between vortex pairs in high-strain areas and glass-like soliton or discommensurations networks. We propose that perturbations, such as strain, drive vortex nucleation and annihilation, leaving solitons or discommensurations pinned by disorder. Electric fields induce soliton and discommensurations movement, causing chiral switching via localized order parameter melting, enabling controllable room-temperature chirality</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physically Consistent Machine Learning for Melting Temperature Prediction of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03801</link><description>arXiv:2601.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic Structure of UGe$_{2\pm x}$ Thin Films from Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03902</link><description>arXiv:2601.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium digermanide UGe$_2$, the first ferromagnetic superconductor, represents a key composition in the U-Ge system dominated by U-5$f$ states. To examine the impact of controlled stoichiometric deviations on the electronic structure, UGe$_{2\pm x}$ thin films ($0 \le x \le 1$) were prepared by triode sputtering and studied on pristine surfaces by X-ray (XPS) and Ultraviolet (UPS) photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS and UPS reveal a robust metallic valence band with a dominant U-5$f$ contribution at the Fermi level and a broad incoherent feature at higher binding energies, without qualitative changes in spectral line shape across the composition range. The experimental spectrum of UGe$_2$ thin films is well reproduced by DFT+U(ED) valence-band calculations combining density functional theory with exact diagonalization of the multiconfigurational U-5$f$ shell. These results demonstrate that the overall U-Ge electronic framework of UGe$_2$ thin films remains resilient to moderate stoichiometric deviations, providing a reliable electronic baseline for future studies of interface- and heterostructure-driven phenomena in uranium-based systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03902v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Sensing in the Dynamics of Quantum Walks with Defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03821</link><description>arXiv:2601.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum sensing leverages unique topological features to suppress noise and improve the precision of parameter estimation, emerging as a promising tool in both fundamental research and practical application. In this Letter, we propose a sensing protocol that exploits the dynamics of topological quantum walks incorporating localized defects. Unlike conventional schemes that rely on topological protection to suppress disorder and defects, our protocol harnesses the evolution time as a resource to enable precise estimation of the defect parameter. By utilizing topologically nontrivial properties of the quantum walks, the sensing precision can approach the Heisenberg limit. We further demonstrate the performance and robustness of the protocol through Bayesian estimation. Our results show that this approach maintains high precision over a broad range of parameters and exhibits strong robustness against disorder, offering a practical pathway for topologically enhanced quantum metrology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03821v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discontinuous transition to active nematic turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link><description>arXiv:2501.06085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded and defect-free active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.06085v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link><description>arXiv:2506.19458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.19458v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12952</link><description>arXiv:2509.12952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases as the film thickness decreases, a reverse size effect absent in perovskite ferroelectrics. Here, we resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to a suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. We further demonstrate that this principle generalizes to conventional perovskites such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate the critical thickness limit by choosing the appropriate film orientation. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12952v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum tunneling and defect-induced transport modulation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21790</link><description>arXiv:2512.21790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21790v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link><description>arXiv:2601.00744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00744v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Semi-Empirical Orbital-Free DFT Approach for Modeling Partial Charges and Interaction Energies</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-sj2j7-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Accurate functionals for the kinetic energy and exchange-correlation potential energy remain a critical challenge within Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (OFDFT).

Their well-defined nuclearity, discrete electronic structures, and tunable ligand environments enable direct structure–activity correlations that are inaccessible with traditional Cu catalysts. This review summarizes recent advances in the use of atomically precise Cu NCs as organocatalysts for a broad range of organic transformations, including cycloadditions, C–C and C–N coupling reactions, hydroboration, hydrogenation, oxidation, protosilylation, sulfonylation, and multicomponent reactions. Emphasis is placed on how subtle structural features—such as nuclearity, hydride content, ligand dynamics, surface defects, mixed-valence states, and exposed metal sites—govern catalytic activity, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. Representative examples illustrate that Cu NCs can operate via radical or polar pathways, act as intrinsic photo- and redox catalysts, and exhibit single-site behavior in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Overall, this review highlights key structure–activity relationships and outlines emerging design principles and future opportunities for developing efficient, sustainable, and earth-abundant Cu-based catalysts.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-m9zzm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Hyperfine Coupling Quantifies Hole Delocalization in Triarylamine Radical Cations of D–χ–A Molecules</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7v3g5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Weak-field magnetic response in spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) is set by the radical-pair hyperfine couplings, making synthetic handles that reshape these couplings important to SCRP design. Here we show the isotropic 14N hyperfine coupling (AN) of triarylamine radical cations provides an experimental metric of hole delocalization in donor–chiral bridge–acceptor molecules. We modulate delocalization through a donor series that varies the N-aryl π-manifold (extension/fusion) and its torsion control. Room-temperature cw-EPR resolves the 14N triplet for radical cations generated chemically and electrochemically. AN decreases as spin density moves off the N-centered aryl and into distal rings, correlating with both DFT Fermi-contact terms and global delocalization metrics. In contrast, the visible–NIR radical-cation absorption contains two overlapping transitions that depend primarily on local N-bound aryl identity and therefore do not uniquely track delocalization. These findings provide a practical route to systematically tuning the effective hyperfine scale relevant to SCRP magnetic response.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7v3g5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Analyzing density-driven errors: Principles and pitfalls</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-18txc-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The theory of density-corrected density functional theory (DC-DFT) separates the error in any approximate DFT calculation into a functional-driven contribution and a density-driven error. Practical DC-DFT calculations often use the Hartree-Fock density instead of a self-consistent DFT density--a method known as HF-DFT--and reduce energetic errors in several classes of chemical problems. Using principles of DC-DFT, we illustrate several pitfalls when analyzing HF-DFT errors, including an interpolator for density-driven errors that is chronically inaccurate, using proxies instead of accurate densities, and conflating common measures of density errors with those of DC-DFT.  We report ideal density-driven errors for one- and two-electron systems, where we can calculate most properties exactly, illustrating these problems. A simple analysis of benchmarking data shows that proxy densities proposed in recent literature are too inaccurate to be useful in DC-DFT. Despite recent claims to the contrary, we show that the success of DC-DFT for barrier heights does not rely on a cancellation of errors, and it is to be expected that HF-DFT errors can be smaller than functional errors, but we fall short of explaining why the improvement is so quantitatively systematic.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-18txc-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Efficient and Accurate Prediction of Adsorption Energies via a Hybrid PBE/CCSD(T) Scheme Using Hydrogen Saturated Clusters</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zbq6f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Accurate prediction of adsorption energies remains a central challenge in heterogeneous catalysis, hindered by the trade-off between computational accuracy and efficiency. Conventional DFT with GGA functionals exhibits systematic overbinding errors, while high-accuracy methods like CCSD(T) remain prohibitively expensive for extended surfaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel hybrid PBE/CCSD(T) embedding scheme. Our key innovations are twofold: (i) a robust hydrogen-saturation protocol for clusters that effectively mitigates boundary effects from truncation, and (ii) a linear interpolation strategy that leverages the strong correlation between PBE and CCSD(T) energies on clusters. This approach requires CCSD(T) calculations only for minimal clusters containing 1-3 metal atoms for CO adsorption on metal surfaces. Validated across a series of CO adsorption systems on transition metal surfaces (Pt, Pd, Rh, Cu, Ir, Ru), our method achieves corrected adsorption energies very close to experimental benchmarks. This work provides a general, efficient, and accurate framework for predictive modeling in surface science and catalysis.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zbq6f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Phase-Templated Poly(ethylene glycol) Sponges for Programmable Porosity and Bone Regeneration</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-jtdlz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Synthetic hydrogels rarely form the porous, cell-permissive architectures required for effective tissue regeneration. Here, we report a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) sponge hydrogel whose macroporous network is pre-programmed through gel–gel phase separation (GGPS) and stabilized by freeze–thaw processing. This mechanism generates fully interconnected pores up to 150 μm in size, larger than those typically achieved in conventional PEG hydrogels, while preserving mechanical resilience and eliminating swelling. The resulting architecture supports infiltration and three-dimensional expansion of human mesenchymal stem cells and directs lineage specification through pore-geometry–dependent mechanotransduction. When functionalized with osteoinductive cues, the sponge promotes robust regeneration of critical-sized cranial defects. By coupling polymer phase behavior with precise structural control, this strategy establishes a scalable route to architecturally defined synthetic scaffolds for regenerative medicine.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-jtdlz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Nonvolatile ferroelectric switching of room-temperature bipolar magnetic semiconductors for energy-efficient spintronics</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02485-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 08 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02485-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-025-02485-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Developing room-temperature magnetic semiconductors with robust, non-volatile electrical control remains a key challenge for energy-efficient spintronics.

Abstract: In this work, using theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory, taking into account the dispersive VDW interaction, the processes of adsorption and interaction of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface in various configurations are investigated. At the atomic/molecular level, the interactions of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface have been studied for various orientations. The results of calculations within the framework of DFT+ VDW show that the adsorption energies of single water molecules in different initial positions on the substrate surface vary from-0.72 to-0.84 eV, and the most stable adsorbate structure is the TiO2+ H2O system upon adsorption of a molecule of water, parallel to the Y axis, because during the adsorption of H2O parallel to the Y axis, some favorable effects are observed in the band structure of titanium dioxide. On the one hand, the band gap decreases to 2.59 eV, and on the other hand, a new energy state appears in the band gap with an energy contribution of 0.17 eV, when water is physisorbed and interacts with a titanium atom at a distance of 2.12 {\AA} and occupies a perpendicular position relative to the surface.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02431v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous Collision of Exceptional Points on Nonorientable Manifolds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02442</link><description>arXiv:2601.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band degeneracies, ranging from Hermitian Dirac points to non-Hermitian exceptional points (EPs), play a central role in topological phase transitions. Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements. Our findings identify nonorientability as a new arena for engineering band degeneracies and topological phases, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the interplay between exceptional and nonorientable topology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strain effects on the binding and diffusion energies of Au adatoms and CeO2 admolcules on Au, CeO2, MgO and SrTiO3 surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02450</link><description>arXiv:2601.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study the effects of elastic strains on the binding and diffusion activation energies of Au adatom and CeO2 admolecule on Au (001), Ce-terminated CeO2 (001), MgO (001), SrO- and TiO2-terminationed SrTiO3 (001) surfaces. In preparation for computing these energies, normal and shear strains within the range 0.15% were applied in the plane of the surface of the supercell prior to placing the adsorbed species on the surface. Our study shows that the dependence of binding energies and diffusion barriers of adatoms and molecules on the strain varies significantly among surfaces. The strain was found to alter the symmetry of surface diffusion pathways causing anisotropy of the diffusion barriers. This strain-induced anisotropy depends on the orientation of the applied strains relative to the in-plane crystallographic directions of the free surface. The binding and diffusion activation energies were fit linearly in terms of strain components in the range 0.15% and the extrapolated values compared favorably to DFT computed values up to 0.5%. The scheme presented here for the computation and fitting of the binding and diffusion energies in terms of strain can be used to inform models of surface diffusion, clustering and growth of multi-component and multi-phase thin films and investigate the effect of strain on the self-organization in such systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02450v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic band structure reconstruction in Ni$_{x}$ZrTe$_{2}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02647</link><description>arXiv:2601.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The filling of the large van der Waals gap in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) often leads to lattice and electronic instabilities, which prelude the onset of a rich phenomenology. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of the TMDs ZrTe$_2$ and Ni-intercalated ZrTe$_2$ (Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, $x\approx 0.05$) employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We readily identify in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$ two flat bands, most likely associated with localized Ni-derived 3$d$-states, at about $\approx-0.7$ eV and $\approx-1.2$ eV in binding energy. The presence of these flat bands is observed for all temperatures ($T$) in our study. More significantly, at low-$T$, we identify an electronic structure reconstruction in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, which halves the electronic periodicity along the $k_{z}$ direction. This is reminiscent of a commensurate band folding with wave-vector $q=(0,0,\pi)$. Together with previous results from macroscopic measurements, namely heat capacity and resistivity, our findings suggest that Ni intercalation drives a structural instability at $T^{*}=287$ K, which causes the observed electronic band reconstruction. Our findings invite further investigation into the structural properties of ZrTe$_2$ and of the intercalated and defect-engineered versions of this material.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Realization of a universal topological waveguide by tuning adiabatic geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02658</link><description>arXiv:2601.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum valley Hall-based topological phases have been attracting attention across diverse fields as a robust platform for wave guidance due to their high compatibility with engineering frameworks. Combining three representative boundary types enables topological waveguides with flexible designability and enhanced functionality. However, one of the three, namely the armchair boundary, has long been limited by inter-valley scattering, resulting in weak topological protection and severely restricting its use in practical devices. This long-standing constraint is a major barrier to realizing broadly applicable topological waveguide systems. Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^{\deg} and 150^{\deg}-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02658v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal coarsening of a two-dimensional Bose gas under conservative evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02687</link><description>arXiv:2601.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase ordering dynamics of a uniform two-dimensional Bose gas quenched to a finite temperature in the superfluid phase. Starting from a defect-rich, far-from-equilibrium state, we model the subsequent evolution with the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which conserves both energy and particle number. By tuning the initial energy, we control the effective post-quench temperature and examine its role in the equilibration dynamics. We find that the gas exhibits universal behaviour at all temperatures, evidenced by spatio-temporal scaling of correlation functions and power-law growth of the correlation length $\sim t^{1/z}$, with $z$ the dynamical critical exponent. We find $z$ to be temperature dependent, with $z \approx 1.5$ for post-quench temperatures just below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and $z \approx 1.9$ for quenches to near-zero temperature. Analysis of the Porod tail of the momentum distribution suggests a temperature-dependent competition between vortices and sound waves in the coarsening process. The two-time correlation function also exhibits universal scaling, decaying as $\sim t^{-\lambda/z}$, with autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Near the BKT transition we obtain $\lambda \approx 2$, whereas $\lambda$ is found to diverge as the effective temperature approaches zero.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anisotropic Kinetics of Ion-Irradiation-Induced Phase Transition in Gallium Oxide</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02770</link><description>arXiv:2601.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-tolerant semiconductors have traditionally been engineered by the principle of suppressing defect accumulation and amorphization, based on the assumption that radiation damage is inherently stochastic. Here we show that, in monoclinic $\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3}, a promising ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor, surface crystallographic orientation deterministically governs radiation tolerance through highly anisotropic kinetics of the $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ phase transition. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics coupled with a local configurational-entropy descriptor, we quantitatively map anisotropic $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ transition kinetics, showing that the critical dose, transition-layer depth, and kinetic stability of the $\gamma$-phase are fundamentally governed by surface orientation. Under ion irradiation, non-channeling surfaces such as (100), (001), and (-201) undergo severe surface amorphization, whereas the strongly channeling (010) surface resists damage accumulation and promotes subsurface $\gamma$-phase nucleation. During thermal annealing recovery process, these initial states follow two distinct recovery pathways: the channeling (010) surface reverts directly from $\gamma$-to-$\beta$, whereas non-channeling surfaces follow a sequential amorphous-to-$\gamma$-to-$\beta$ transition pathway. This work establishes surface orientation as a fundamental design principle for achieving radiation tolerance through controlled polymorphic transitions, providing a universal framework for engineering functional materials capable of withstanding extreme irradiation environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transformation Journey of Zr-based MOFs: Study on Mechanics and Hydrogen Storage under Doping Regulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02794</link><description>arXiv:2601.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the transformation journey of Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), focusing on enhancing their mechanical properties and hydrogen storage capacities through doping regulation. MOFs, a versatile class of crystalline porous materials, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad potential applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, and sensing. Among them, Zr-based MOFs stand out for their exceptional stability and high surface area. This research systematically investigates six key Zr-based MOFs (UIO-66, UIO-67, UIO-68, MOF-801, MOF-802, and MOF-841) using multiscale computational methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT). The study explores the impact of metal ion substitution (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) on the mechanical and hydrogen storage properties of these MOFs. Our findings reveal that metal ion substitution significantly influences the mechanical stability and hydrogen adsorption capacity of Zr-based MOFs, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance MOF materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02794v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interface-induced band bending and charge separation in all-organic ZnPc/F$_x$ZnPc heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03167</link><description>arXiv:2601.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors are attractive building blocks for electronic devices due to their low cost and flexibility. Furthermore, heterostructures with type-II band alignments can efficiently separate photogenerated charges via a charge transfer and separation process.
  Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate model interfaces formed by zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and its fluorinated derivatives (F$_8$ZnPc and F$_{16}$ZnPc). We demonstrate that these interfaces not only exhibit a type-II band offset, but also band bending. The band bending causes both the LUMO and HOMO states to localize away from the interface. Therefore, the band bending creates a strong driving force for charge separation. We used ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) to experimentally confirm this predicted band bending. The wavefunction envelopes of vertically-stacked molecules resemble particle-in-a-box states, but this shape is lost when the molecules are staggered.
  These results elucidate how interface-induced band bending facilitates charge separation in all-organic heterostructures and suggest a design pathway toward improved performance in organic photovoltaic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03167v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emulating 2D Materials with Magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03210</link><description>arXiv:2601.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03210v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Restoring Bloch's Theorem for Cavity Exciton Polaron-Polaritons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03230</link><description>arXiv:2601.03230v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in the field of nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.17223v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transforming Acidic Corrosion and Embrittlement into a Hydrogen-Trapping Cage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05481</link><description>arXiv:2506.05481v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vision of a hydrogen economy demands efficient platforms to close the gap between sustainable proton sources and solid-state hydrogen carriers. Metal hydrides serve as key carriers, yet their synthesis remains constrained by the energy-intensive use of high-pressure H2, which fragments the hydrogen chain. Here, we overturn this paradigm by transforming two classic degradation mechanisms, acidic corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, into a constructive materials-design strategy. We demonstrate that synergistic control of these processes in acid enables the in-situ engineering of a "hydrogen-trapping cage" (HTC) microstructure within metals. Composed of a dense defect network, this cage directly captures and stabilizes protons as hydrides under mild conditions, guided by the universal criterion |DeltaPeq| &gt; DeltaPph. Using this platform, we synthesize over 20 hydrides, including challenging targets such as LiH and NaH, and showcase its functional power with a cage-rich titanium hydride electrocatalyst. This catalyst achieves an exceptional current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, attributed to rapid H- transport within the engineered cage. This work establishes a transformative "failure-to-function" paradigm, delivering an integrated platform that unifies hydrogen capture, stabilization, and conversion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05481v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pseudopotentials for Orbital-Free DFT: Capturing Nonlocality and Correcting Functional Approximants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19892</link><description>arXiv:2511.19892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.19892v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritiated graphene: combining nuclear quantum mechanics with Density Functional Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13259</link><description>arXiv:2504.13259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.13259v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07974</link><description>arXiv:2512.07974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

We consider the cases of grouplike and duality defects in detail for the Ising model, and find agreement with all numerically found entanglement entropies.

Substituting Sc at the Al sites provides an effective means to tune these barriers, significantly lowering the energy cost of polarization reversal and enabling controllable ferroelectric performance for targeted applications.

These are often used in conjunction with linear response TD-DFT to get the excited state energy and its gradients. At each step of an MD simulation, the new molecular geometry is relatively close to the previous ones, suggesting that some extrapolation strategy can be applied, such that the results of the previous calculations, which are available for free, can be used to predict the result of the upcoming calculation. The prediction can then be used as a guess for the iterative solver to lower the number of iterations and thus the cost. In this contribution, we present an extension of the Grassmann extrapolation scheme (GExt) to linear response TD-DFT, in which the knowledge about the manifold structure to which the solutions belong is used to make the extrapolation more accurate. The new extrapolation strategy is then tested on four systems showing a significant acceleration of the excited state molecular dynamics.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mqwxc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Retraining and evaluating EquiformerV2 machine-learning potentials for global optimization of Mo2C nanoclusters</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-xcsp0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nanoclusters enriched in coordinatively unsaturated metal sites usually exhibit distinct geometric and electronic properties and outperform bulk catalysts.

Our investigation reveals that, at intermediate temperatures (300–600 °C) an interplay of mechanisms: (i) local structural disorder (higher compared to YSZ), (ii) increasing specific heat at elevated temperatures, and (iii) moderate translucency—synergistically suppresses the phonon transport and produces a plateau-like thermal conductivity. At elevated temperatures (beyond 600 °C), due to the translucency of CaSZ ceramics in both the visible and mid-infrared range, it allows radiative transport to become significant, leading to an overall increase in the thermal conductivity. This interplay between lattice (phonon) and radiative (photon) parts of thermal transport is enabled by the unique defect chemistry and translucency of the CaSZ ceramics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/012201/3376786/Unusual-glass-like-thermal-conductivity-trend-in</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Origin of ferroelectricity and anti-ferroelectricity via doping and oxygen vacancy effects in lanthanum-doped hafnium zirconium oxide thin films</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/012903/3376785/Origin-of-ferroelectricity-and-anti</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Lanthanum-doped hafnium zirconium oxide (La:HZO) has demonstrated high potential to solve the endurance challenge of hafnia-based ferroelectric memory. To date, La:HZO has been experimentally reported to exhibit ferroelectricity (FE) with lower La concentration (&amp;lt;1 mol. %) but anti-ferroelectricity (AFE) with higher La concentration that exceeds 1 mol. %. Despite the improved endurance with the introduction of La dopants, there still lacks an in-depth understanding to explain the mechanisms behind FE to AFE transition. In this work, we theoretically studied the origin of FE and AFE characteristics in La:HZO thin films through first-principles calculations. The polarization switching process was also analyzed based on the Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire theory. The calculation results reveal that the dominant phase in La:HZO changes from non-FE monoclinic to FE orthorhombic to AFE tetragonal phase with increasing the concentration of La dopants, which results in FE-AFE transition. During the process, the presence of oxygen vacancies also facilitates the formation of the tetragonal phase, which highlights the significant role of oxygen vacancies in phase stabilization. Our findings explain the physical origin of the narrow doping window in La:HZO and provide a theoretical basis for optimizing HZO-based ferroelectric devices by regulating the concentration of dopants and oxygen vacancies within the film.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/012903/3376785/Origin-of-ferroelectricity-and-anti</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia] The behavior of point defects and their impact on the formation of helium bubbles in refractory high-entropy alloys</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645426000066?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 5 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Acta Materialia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Jiuxi Yuan, Zhixi Zhu, Qiuhong Zhang, Yuqing Zhao, Ke Jin, Yunfei Xue, Xun Guo&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:27:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645426000066</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Chemically Grounded Evaluation Framework for Generative Models in Materials Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00886</link><description>arXiv:2601.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Visualization of Excitonic Pair Breaking at Individual Impurities in Ta2Pd3Te5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01096</link><description>arXiv:2601.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic insulators host the condensates of bound electron-hole pairs, offering a platform for studying correlated bosonic quantum states. Yet, how macroscopic coherence emerges from locally collapsed pairing remains elusive. Here, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we report the impurity-induced pair breaking in an excitonic insulator Ta2Pd3Te5. Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states. These observations, together with mean-field modelling, suggest an excitonic pair-breaking origin. In the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, a secondary pair-breaking effect, manifesting as an additional pair of subgap states with distinctly lower energies, can emerge, presenting the interplay of pairing breakings with different excitonic order parameters. Our findings demonstrate the spectroscopic 'fingerprint' of local excitonic depairing at the atomic level, offering a crucial clue to the critical behavior across excitonic condensation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Coherent B2 Stability in Ru-Containing Refractory Alloys Through Thermodynamic Elastic Design Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01326</link><description>arXiv:2601.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tripling of the Superconducting Critical Current Density in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ Retained After Pressure Release</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01328</link><description>arXiv:2601.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting performance is tunable not only via chemical modification or defect engineering, but also through external parameters such as pressure, though this method remains less readily accessible. In this work, we study how compression influences vortex dynamics and critical currents in an iron-based superconductor. Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $\delta \kappa$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $\delta T_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of pressure cycling for improving $J_c$, which may offer a simpler alternative to approaches such as chemical doping or the introduction of artificial pinning centers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular simulation of methane hydrate growth confined into a silica pore</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01329</link><description>arXiv:2601.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of a methane hydrate seed within a silica slit pore of fixed width has been studied using AllAtom Molecular Dynamics (AA-MD). An AA force field has been used to describe the molecules of the solid silica substrate, with a-quartz crystalline structure. The crystallisation of hydrates in confined geometries is not well understood yet, and the objective of this work is to study the hydrate growth inside a silica pore using molecular simulation. Both NVT and NpT ensembles were used in the AA-MD simulations to analyse the hydrate growth from an initial seed. Results showed that the boundary conditions imposed by the nanometric slit pore yielded a hydrate with structural defects, filling the accessible space between the silica walls. The water molecules which were not incorporated to the initial seed hydrate formed a high density water layer trapped between the silica walls and the crystallised hydrate. These results provide an interesting insight into the hydrate crystallisation process in confined geometries, resembling those found in natural hydrate deposits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spontaneous growth of perfectly circular domains of MoS2 monolayers using chemical vapour deposition technique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01463</link><description>arXiv:2601.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very large-scale integration of devices in a circular pattern has several advantages over the commonly used rectangular grid layout. For the development of such integrated circuits on a 2D semiconductor platform, spontaneous growth of the material in the form of circular islands is desirable. Here, we report the natural formation of 1L-MoS2 circular islands of diameter as large as a few hundreds of micrometer on SiO2/Si substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique without the use of any seeding layer. The size of the circles is found to increase with the amount of sulphur used during growth. The study reveals that these circular islands are formed with a less-defective interior and a more-defective outer part that is dominated by a large density of grain boundaries and twists. Due to the lower defect density, the interior region yields much higher photoluminescence than the peripheral part. Field effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated on inner and outer portions of a circle to estimate the mobility and concentration of the background carriers in the two regions. The study shows that the maximum mobility is more than double in the interior than the outer part. While the carrier concentration remains practically unchanged in the two regions. The natural tendency to minimize the strain energy resulting from the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the monolayer and the substrate as well as the edge energy that originates from the boundary tension are thought to be the driving forces behind the formation of these circular domains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01463v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electrical Regulation of Transverse Spin Currents in Unconventional Magnetic Ferroeletrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01499</link><description>arXiv:2601.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify hexagonal YMnO$_3$ as a material realization of the elusive $\beta$-phase of unconventional magnetism, a noncollinear, noncoplanar antiferromagnetic state defined by intrinsic spin-momentum locking and a topological spin texture. First-principle calculations reveal that this unique electronic structure enables a perpendicular electric field to generate a transverse pure spin current, a response that occurs without requiring relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Symmetry analysis demonstrates that this spin current is intimately related to the material's ferroelectric polarization that breaks the inversion symmetry and is rigorously forbidden at domain walls where electrical polarization vanishes. This provides a blueprint for a non-volatile transistor where a gate voltage switches the spin current conductivity by controlling domain wall density, enabling all-electrical control for energy-efficient antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Band-Edge Carrier Trapping Limits Light Emission in WSe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01529</link><description>arXiv:2601.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit bright photoluminescence, a desirable property for light-emitting diodes and single-photon emitters. Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two-Qubit Module Based on Phonon-Coupled Ge Hole-Spin Qubits: Design, Fabrication, and Readout at 1-4 K</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01704</link><description>arXiv:2601.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a device-level design for a two-qubit module based on phonon-coupled germanium (Ge) hole-spin qubits operating at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Building on prior work on phonon-engineered Ge qubits and phononic-crystal (PnC) cavities, we specify a lithography-ready layout that integrates two gate-defined hole-spin qubits in a strained Ge quantum well with a GHz PnC defect mode that mediates a coherent phonon-based interaction. We detail the SiGe/Ge heterostructure, PnC cavity design, and a compatible nanofabrication process flow, including the gate stack, membrane patterning and release, and RF/DC wiring. We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocations, vacancies and interstitials in the two-dimensional one-component plasma</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01809</link><description>arXiv:2601.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energetics and stability of dislocations, vacancies and, interstitials in the one-component plasma (OCP), where the charges interact with a log potential and move on the curved surface of a cylinder have been investigated numerically. For vacancy-interstitial pairs, the log term of the direct Coulomb attraction and the elastic displacement energy cancel exactly at long distances, resulting in a defect energy of O(1). The numerical results confirm the predicted asymptotic behavior but also identify critical distances below which pairs evolve to different forms. We have found that bound pairs of dislocations - created by adding or removing 120 degree zig-zags of particles - have a dependence on their preparation history which is not accounted for in the usual starting point of the KTHNY theory. Furthermore, isolated dislocations, whose presence disrupts crystalline order, have energies of O(1) at some values of N, the number of particles in the system, and therefore will be thermally excited, raising questions about the applicability of standard KTHNY theory to the OCP, and supporting older suggestions that there are no phase transitions at all in the two-dimensional OCP.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906</link><description>arXiv:2601.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Score-based diffusion models for accurate crystal-structure inpainting and reconstruction of hydrogen positions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01959</link><description>arXiv:2601.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge disproportionation as a possible mechanism towards polar antiferromagnetic metal in molecular orbital crystal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02048</link><description>arXiv:2601.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Design of Defect States in Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Telecommunication-Band Quantum Emission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02068</link><description>arXiv:2601.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect-based single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising platforms for integrated quantum photonics; however, the absence of identified emitters operating at telecom wavelengths remains a critical limitation for fiber-based quantum communication. Here, we investigate previously unexplored carbon- and silicon-based point defects in monolayer h-BN as SPE candidates using hybrid density functional theory, constrained excited-state relaxations, and a generating-function approach to photoluminescence. We compute zero-phonon-line (ZPL) energies, radiative lifetimes, Huang-Rhys (HR) factors, and photoluminescence lineshapes to screen optical performance. All defects are thermodynamically stable with negative formation energies, and five candidates exhibit moderate electron-phonon coupling (HR &lt; 5), indicating narrow emission linewidths. These emitters span a broad spectral range from the visible to the telecom regime, including near-infrared C-based centers and, most notably, the Si2BVN defect, which is identified as the first point defect in monolayer h-BN predicted to support single-photon emission in the telecom C band (1554 nm). Vacancy-containing complexes possess spin-1/2 ground states, enabling spin-photon interfaces compatible with integrated photonic and cavity-based platforms. The combined analysis of ZPL energies, electron-phonon coupling, and radiative lifetimes provides concrete targets for experimental realization of spin-active single-photon emitters in h-BN from the visible to telecom wavelengths.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Competing phases and domain structures of ferroelectric perovskites: the benefit of epitaxial (110) growth</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02118</link><description>arXiv:2601.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain and domain engineering offer powerful routes to control phase and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films. While most studies have focused on (100)-oriented growth, the impact of lower-symmetry orientations remains underexplored. We address this gap in knowledge with first-principles based molecular dynamics simulation for the example of prototypical ferroelectric perovskites under (110) strain. Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic stress response kernels for dislocations and cracks: unified anisotropic Lagrangian formulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02124</link><description>arXiv:2601.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastodynamic cohesive-zone models for defects such as cracks or dislocations (such as the Geubelle-Rice model for cracks, or the Dynamic Peierls Equation for flat-core dislocations), feature the same stress-response convolution kernel in space and time. It accounts for in-plane elastic wave propagation, while its associated instantaneous radiative term accounts for radiative losses in the surrounding medium. These objects are well-known for isotropic elasticity, with their space-time representations involving generalized functions. For anisotropic elasticity they were unknown. The paper presents a derivation using the Stroh formalism. Their Fourier representation rests exclusively on the so-called prelogarithmic Lagrangian factor $L(v)$, while their space-time form involves its derivative $p(v)=L'(v)$, the prelogarithmic impulsion function. A straightforward consequence is the reformulation of the stress in the Weertman model of steadily-moving dislocations in terms of $L(v)$. Special care being paid to the causality constraint, the theory covers indifferently subsonic, intersonic and supersonic regimes of motion. The theory proposed is suitable to phase-field-type Fourier-based numerical codes for planar systems of defects in anisotropic elastodynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the Static Kuhn Length: Conformational Substructures and Relaxation Dynamics in Flexible Chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02127</link><description>arXiv:2601.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical "monomer-based" segment length $b$ and the Kuhn length $l_k$ are central to polymer physics, yet the minimal size required for a truly statistical segment - Gaussian, uncorrelated, and valid as an entropic spring - is not rigorously established. Using atomistic simulations of entangled polyethylene, we re-evaluate these foundational quantities.
  By fitting end-to-end distance distributions of C--C bond blocks and validating with higher-moment analyses, we identify for the first time the minimal sizes corresponding to a statistical segment and an entropic spring. A single Kuhn segment (approximately 11 bonds) is the smallest statistically uncorrelated unit, but its distance distribution is strongly non-Gaussian, while the monomer-based segment $b$, used in rheology and classical tube-theory formulations, is not statistical at all. True Gaussianity emerges only for blocks containing multiple Kuhn segments.
  At the Kuhn scale, we uncover a previously unresolved conformational heterogeneity. Each segment samples a broad range of conformations, from coiled (approximately 4~\AA) to extended (approximately 14~\AA), giving rise to three distinct substructures: aligned chain segments (ACS), random conformational sequences (RCS), and chain ends (CE). These exhibit distinct dynamical signatures. ACS relax with a stretched-exponential exponent $\beta \approx 0.5$, consistent with quasi-one-dimensional, defect-mediated localized modes, whereas RCS and CE relax with $\beta \approx 0.7$. By connecting these results to localized-mode theory and continuous-time random-walk models, we provide a molecular interpretation of stretched-exponential relaxation in polymer melts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02127v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Morphology dependent decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation of Cr$_2$AlC coatings revealed by correlative tomography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02216</link><description>arXiv:2601.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative 3D characterization of materials degradation in oxidizing environments remains limited. Here, we apply a correlative tomography-based mass balance framework to Cr$_2$AlC, a coating candidate for accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings and turbine blades, and show that decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation, quantified by integrating volumetric, structural and compositional data, are strongly governed by grain morphology. The oxidation of sputtered Cr$_2$AlC coatings with equiaxed and columnar grain morphologies was analyzed. While Cr$_7$C$_3$ formed in both coating morphologies, pores formed exclusively in columnar coatings. The expected Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume was estimated by mass-balance calculations assuming that Al-deintercalation enables oxide scale and Al-O-C-N precipitate formation, leading to complete transformation of the Al-deintercalated Cr$_2$AlC into Cr$_7$C$_3$. In equiaxed coatings, the predicted carbide volume agreed with tomography within 3 $\pm$ 3 %, confirming Al-deintercalation-driven Cr$_7$C$_3$ formation. Despite the smaller molar volume of Cr$_7$C$_3$ relative to Cr$_2$AlC, absence of pores imply that transformation shrinkage is likely accommodated by coating thickness reduction. In columnar coatings, the predicted Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume exceeds the measured value by 22 $\pm$ 4 %, and the pore volume expected from transformation shrinkage alone is 13-16 % lower than measured, indicating partial Al deintercalation and clustering of pre-existing defects. This combined methodology provides a general route to quantitatively resolve degradation mechanisms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic correlations and topology in Kondo insulator PuB$_6$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02312</link><description>arXiv:2601.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a combination of dynamical mean field theory and density functional theory (DMFT/DFT), it has been theoretically proposed that PuB$_6$ is a strongly correlated topological insulator characterized by nontrivial $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ topological invariants and metallic surface states (\textit{X. Deng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 176404 (2013)}). Here, we demonstrate through low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and first-principles calculations that PuB$6$ exhibits characteristics of a topological Kondo insulating state. These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($\Delta{\rho} \sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02312v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Selective Imperfection as a Generative Framework for Analysis, Creativity and Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00863</link><description>arXiv:2601.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00863v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Analog Weight Update Rule in Ferroelectric Hafnia, using pico-Joule Programming Pulses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01186</link><description>arXiv:2601.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effort to compete with the brain's efficiency at processing information, neuromorphic hardware combines artificial synapses and neurons using mixed-signal circuits and emerging memories. In ferroelectric resistive weights, the strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons is stored in the device conductance. During learning, programming pulses are applied to the synaptic weight, which reconfigures the ferroelectric domains and adjusts the conductance. One strategy to lower the energy cost during the training phase is to lower the duration of the programming pulses. However, the latter cannot be shorter than the self-loading time of the resistive weights, limited by intrinsic parasitics in the circuits. In this work, ferroelectric resistive weights are fabricated using a process compatible with CMOS Back-End-Of-Line integration, based on hafnia/zirconia nanolaminates. By laterally scaling the device area under 100 $\mu$m$^2$, the self-loading time becomes sufficiently short to enable 20 ns programming, which corresponds to a maximum of 3 picoJoules per pulse. Further, in this work, the weight update rule with 20 ns pulses is experimentally measured not only for different amplitudes but also for different initial conductance states. We find that the final weight is determined by the pulse amplitude, independent of the initial weight value.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theoretical Study of C36 and O@C36 Fullerene Isomers with (C1, C2, Cs, D2, D3h) symmetries: Geometry Optimization, Electrical Properties and Spectroscopic Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02041</link><description>arXiv:2601.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h &lt; C36-C1 &lt; C36-Cs &lt; C36-C2 &lt; C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Study of Dispersion-Corrected Electronic and Optical Properties of syn- and anti- B18H22 Clusters with/without Sulfur Doping for Tunable Optoelectronics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02049</link><description>arXiv:2601.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation of the electronic and excited-state properties of syn- and anti-isomers of the borane cluster B18H22 and their sulfur-doped derivatives.
  Using the PB86/def2-SVP level of theory with dispersion corrections, the research examines how sulfur substitution and non-covalent interactions influence cluster stability, electronic structure, spectra, and optoelectronic potential. Comparative analysis of the syn- and anti-isomers reveals the impact of molecular conformation on frontier molecular orbitals and related energetic and photophysical properties. Sulfur doping is shown to enhance charge delocalization, stabilize excited states, and improve thermal stability, which form key factors for tunable laser applications.
  The inclusion of advanced dispersion correction methods proves essential for accurately capturing many-body interactions that govern electronic behavior. By elucidating the interplay between structural features, substitution patterns, and computational modeling, the work provides valuable insights into structure-property relationships critical for designing borane-based materials with tailored optoelectronic and thermal characteristics. In addition to doping and dispersion effects, functionals' effects were examined through comparison amidst various ones with different asymptotic exchange on excitation and gap energies. In summary, the computational methodology combined good DFT/Basis/dispersion set to accurately predict geometries, IR/UV spectra, NMR chemical shifts, dipole moments, polarizability and excited-state properties, thereby offering a comprehensive theoretical understanding of syn-, anti- isomers of B18H22 and its sulfur doped variants.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase transitions in a three dimensional $U(1) \times U(1)$ lattice London superconductor: Metallic superfluid and charge-4e superconducting states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3311</link><description>arXiv:1006.3311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional lattice $U(1) \times U(1)$ and $[U(1)]^N$ superconductors in the London limit, with individually conserved condensates. The $U(1) \times U(1)$ problem, generically, has two types of intercomponent interactions of different characters. First, the condensates are interacting via a minimal coupling to the same fluctuating gauge field. A second type of coupling is the direct dissipationless drag represented by a local intercomponent current-current coupling term in the free energy functional. In this work, we present a study of the phase diagram of a $U(1) \times U(1)$ superconductor which includes both of these interactions. We study phase transitions and two types of competing paired phases which occur in this general model: (i) a metallic superfluid phase (where there is order only in the gauge invariant phase difference of the order parameters), (ii) a composite superconducting phase where there is order in the phase sum of the order parameters which has many properties of a single-component superconductor but with a doubled value of electric charge. We investigate the phase diagram with particular focus on what we call ``preemptive phase transitions.'' These are phase transitions unique to multicomponent condensates with competing topological objects. A sudden proliferation of one kind of topological defects may come about due to a fluctuating background of topological defects in other sectors of the theory. For $U(1) \times U(1)$ theory with unequal bare stiffnesses where components are coupled by a non-compact gauge field only, we study how this scenario leads to a merger of two $U(1)$ transitions into a single $U(1) \times U(1)$ discontinuous phase transition. We also report a general form of vortex-vortex bare interaction potential and possible phase transitions in an $N$-component London superconductor with individually conserved condensates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1006.3311v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-dependent Transport Studies of Fe/Mo$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S$_2$/Fe Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16440</link><description>arXiv:2504.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin dependent electron transport in Fe/Mo$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S$_2$/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and with substitutional doping of 3d transition metal Cr at Mo site in MoS2 is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows the presence of metal-induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2/Fe interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunnelling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity Cr, the tunnelling magnetoresistance for 7-layer junction is reduced. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band, and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. Spin-transport through close-packed Fe(111) surface as electrode show low GMR value.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.16440v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Higher critical currents yet faster vortex creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing coherent artificial pinning centers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01119</link><description>arXiv:2507.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices -- magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO$_3$ inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density $J_c$ based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing high concentrations of BaHfO$_3$. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO$_3$ increases creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ even while concomitantly improving $J_c$. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that $J_c$ is maximized at the BaHfO$_3$ concentration that hosts creep of large vortex bundles or a Bose glass state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01119v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing the band structure of the strongly correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3 across its phase transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14890</link><description>arXiv:2507.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.14890v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link><description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23783v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theoretical Investigation of Performance-Improved Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction Based on Trap-Assisted Tunneling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12879</link><description>arXiv:2508.12879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges that hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the simulated TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high current density and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08194v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discrete Shift and Polarization from Response to Symmetry Defects in Interacting Topological Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19483</link><description>arXiv:2510.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the previous study of extracting crystalline symmetry-protected topological invariants to the correlated regime. We construct the interacting Hofstadter model defined on square lattice with the rotation and translation symmetry defects: disclination and dislocation. The model realizes Chern insulator and the charge density wave state as one tunes interactions. Employing the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we calculate the excess charge around the defects and find that the topological invariants remain quantized in both phases, with the topological quantity extracted to great precision. This study paves the way for utilizing matrix product state, and potentially other quantum many-body computation methods, to efficiently study crystalline symmetry defects on 2D interacting lattice systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.19483v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DeFecT-FF: Accelerated Modeling of Defects in Cd-Zn--Te-Se-S Compounds Combining High-Throughput DFT and Machine Learning Force Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23514</link><description>arXiv:2510.23514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23514v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link><description>arXiv:2512.23364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23364v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Melting curve of correlated iron at Earth's core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25061</link><description>arXiv:2512.25061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable constraints on iron's melting curve at Earth's inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25061v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link><description>arXiv:2601.00744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00744v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04321</link><description>arXiv:2508.04321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04321v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Bright Insights into Luminescent Nickel(II): Exploring Ligand Rigidity and Ultrafast Deactivation Pathways via Theory and Experiment</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dg8w0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In this work, we elucidate the origin of the unique luminescence of a square-planar 3d nickel(II) complex, [Ni(L−CH3)], and explain its quenching in the differently substituted [Ni(L−CF3)] through a combination of high-level multiconfigurational wave function methods and transient absorption spectroscopy. The strong agreement between computed activation barriers and experimental kinetic data validates the predicted deactivation mechanisms. In addition, the new theoretical results prompted a re-evaluation of experimental UV–vis absorption spectra published earlier by some of us. The updated analysis reveals a previously overlooked, concentration-dependent oligomerization of [Ni(L−CH3)], which accounts for the complexity of the visible absorption envelope. We uncover a delicate energetic balance between competing relaxation pathways that renders non-radiative deactivating electronic states inaccessible for the −CH3 complex, yet accessible in its −CF3 analog. In addition to common metal-centered triplet and singlet states, we have identified a class of excited states that are crucial for the differing photoactivity of the two species. These states arise from antiferromagnetic coupling of two local triplet states, metal and ligand, into an overall singlet. They are (a) not described by conventional TD-DFT approaches, due to their inherently multiconfigurational character, and (b) not widely recognized within the inorganic photochemistry community.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dg8w0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Synthesis and Characterization of the First Enol-Germenolate and its Keto-Germenolate Tautomer</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-c7ptj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The enol-tautomer of a germenolate - [(tBuMe2Si)2Ge=C(OLi·Et2O)(1 Ad)]2 (8) (1 Ad=1 adamantyl), and its keto-tautomer (tBuMe2Si)2Ge–C(=O···Li·15-crown-5)(1 Ad) (9), were synthesized, isolated, and characterized by X-ray crystallography, NMR, ssNMR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Enol-germenolate 8 is the first reported enol-tautomer of a germenolate. 8 has a nearly planar geometry around the Ge atom (Σ∡(Ge)=355.1°) and a short Ge=C bond (1.885 Å). In contrast, its keto-tautomer 9 has pyramidal geometry around the Ge (Σ∡(Ge) = 299.0°) and a significantly longer Ge–C bond (2.062 Å). This is the first example of a heavy Group 14 enolate, which can be isolated as both the keto- and the enol-tautomer, depending on the coordinated solvent. In THF solution, the precursor germenolate exists mainly as the keto-tautomer (tBuMe2Si)2Ge–C(=O···Li·nTHF)(1 Ad) (10).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were combined to correlate grain orientation and surface morphology changes with experimental conditions that drive shape formation. Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive voltammetric analysis across a broad range of stepped single-crystal electrodes, demonstrating that blank cyclic voltammograms in NaCl effectively decouple terrace and step contributions on copper. Our results revealed that while chloride tends to form structures comprising (100) terraces and (111) or (110) defects when oxidation-reduction pulses are applied to refacet copper, the deposition rate, determined by the ER, controls the length of the created (100) terraces and defect density. The oxidation and reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated as model structure-sensitive reactions to probe how variations in the terrace-to-defect ratio affect catalytic behavior. Low-coordinated sites promote oxidation of HMF, whereas (100) terraces adjacent to steps lower the onset potential for HMF reduction. By identifying the active surface facets, this work demonstrates that surface structure engineering is a powerful approach to advance electrocatalysis on copper.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-m2khp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Probing Molecular Organization in Polar Nematic Phases: A Combined FTIR Spectroscopy and Molecular Simulation Approach</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9bf98?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However,
the relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting
macroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using
a combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S ≈ 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase. This study demonstrates that the unique properties of polar nematics are governed by specific molecular self-assembly and establishes phase biaxiality as a key feature
of these systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9bf98?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene heterostructure</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68072-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 06 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68072-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68072-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This study shows that electrically switchable and non-volatile dipoles can form at the interface of graphene and α-RuCl3 when separated by an ultrathin hBN layer.

Results show that J–V characteristics exhibit a reduction in turn-on voltage and an evident enhancement in forward current density along with an increase in carrier concentration, induced by irradiation. In combination with deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) characterization, it is observed that an evolution of intrinsic defects is primarily related to proton-implantation. In transient spectra, the strength of peak E1 (Ec − 0.46 eV) is significantly reduced, while that of peak E2 (Ec − 0.60 eV) is enhanced. Therefore, the evolution of defects is inevitably attributed to the energy loss and dynamic collision of incident protons, which is supported by the characterization of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

However, the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in HZO films thicker than 20 nm remains a persistent challenge, fundamentally limiting their applications in piezoelectric transducers, pyroelectric detectors, and energy storage devices. Here, we propose a tetragonal-phase nucleation strategy guided by phase-field simulation, breaking through the thickness barrier for high-performance ferroelectric HZO films. Through a newly developed phase-field crystallization model, we first identify that a higher initial density of tetragonal-phase nuclei concurrently enhances low-temperature crystallinity and promotes the formation of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase. Furthermore, an innovative HZO (3.5 nm)/ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.5 nm) multilayer film is designed to increase tetragonal-phase nucleation density. The 54-nm-thick film annealed at an unprecedentedly low temperature of 400 °C exhibits a high fraction of ferroelectric phase and excellent ferroelectric properties. Notably, it achieves a remanent polarization significantly exceeding that of sub-20-nm-thick HZO films prepared by conventional processes. Our study advances the understanding of ferroelectric phase formation in HZO films while simultaneously extending their technological applicability.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011405/3376433/Atomic-layer-deposition-of-HZO-ferroelectric-films</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Molecular-scale crosslinking engineering enables defect-reduced hard carbon with 3D conductive network for high-performance sodium-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25048546?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 20 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 147&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Zhuo Xiong, Xingyue Yang, Mengfei Du, Weiyue Li, Liangzhi Li, Yuxin Xue, Xiurong Lan, Qiang Wang, Jianping Long, Rui Li, Jian Chen, Anjun Hu&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:27:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25048546</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Domain Nucleation and Growth in an Epitaxially Grown Wurtzite Ferroelectric</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202510493?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, 5 January 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:13:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202510493</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Defect‐Engineered Inert Interfaces on Iron‐Rich Clay Minerals Boost Exclusive Electron Transfer Pathway in Fenton‐Like Reactions</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202512238?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, 5 January 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:13:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202512238</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Ion Irradiation of Halide Perovskites: Role of Defect Engineering for Enhanced Performance</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202512001?af=R</link><description>Small, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:53:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202512001</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] In Situ Carbon‐Coated Na2CO3@C as a High‐Capacity Sacrificial Additive: Enhancing Presodiation Efficiency via Defect‐Driven Electron Transfer</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202512214?af=R</link><description>Small, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:34:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202512214</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Deformable Eutectic Alloy With Near‐Theoretical Yield Strength via Hierarchical Nanoscale Multiphases and Sessile Defects</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202518764?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:04:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202518764</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stable spin textures, have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in information storage and processing. They are typically stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the presence of a magnetic field and can be manipulated by electric fields in magnetoelectric systems. Here we investigate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the behavior of skyrmions in a classical Heisenberg magnetoelectric model on the square lattice under combined magnetic and electric fields. We analyze spin and dipolar textures, structure factors, magnetization, chirality, and polarization for different field directions and magnitudes, identifying ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, spiral, skyrmion crystal, skyrmion gas, and bimeron phases, as well as the field-induced transitions between them. We find that the competition between electric and magnetic fields can destroy or transform skyrmion lattices into skyrmion-gas or bimeron phases. While magnetic fields induce chiral phases even in the presence of an electric field, electric fields strongly reshape the chiral region and deform skyrmion textures. This reciprocal influence between magnetic and electric orders reflects the intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling characteristic of multiferroic materials. Specifically, we observe the simultaneous sudden growth in magnetization with a switch-off in the polarization, typically observed in experiments. In this context, localized magnetoelectric entities, such as skyrmions carrying electric quadrupoles, exemplify the intertwined nature of spin and charge degrees of freedom, providing a microscopic basis for the control of topological states in ME systems and their potential use in spintronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Mechanisms of Li-Ion Transport Mediated by Li10GeP2S12 in Composite Solid Polyethylene Oxide Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00112</link><description>arXiv:2601.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Sampling of Boron Diffusion in Ni Alloys: Cr and Mo Effects on Bulk and Grain Boundary Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00117</link><description>arXiv:2601.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how light interstitials migrate in chemically complex alloys is essential for predicting defect dynamics and long-term stability. Here, we introduce a spectral sampling framework to quantify boron diffusion activation energies in Ni and demonstrate how substitutional solutes (Cr, Mo) reshape interstitial point defect transport in both the bulk and along crystallographic defects. In the bulk, boron migration energy distributions exhibit distinct modality tied to solute identity and spatial arrangement: both Cr and Mo raise barriers in symmetric cages but induce directional asymmetry in partially decorated environments. Extending this framework to a $\Sigma5\langle100\rangle{210}$ symmetric tilt grain boundary reveals solute-specific confinement effects. Cr preserves low-barrier in-plane mobility while suppressing out-of-plane transport, guiding boron into favorable midplane voids. Mo, by contrast, imposes an across-the-board reduction in boron mobility, suppressing average diffusivity by two additional orders of magnitude at 800 $^\circ$C and reducing out-of-plane transport by five orders of magnitude relative to Cr. Both elements promote segregation by producing negative segregation energies, but their roles diverge: Cr facilitates rapid redistribution and stabilization at interfacial sites, consistent with Cr-rich boride formation, while Mo creates deeper and more uniform segregation wells that strongly anchor boron. Together, these complementary behaviors explain the experimental prevalence of Cr- and Mo-rich borides at grain boundaries and carbide interfaces in Ni-based superalloys. More broadly, we establish spectral sampling as a transferable framework for interpreting diffusion in disordered alloys and for designing dopant strategies that control transport across complex interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct imaging of stress tensor around single dislocation in diamond</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00261</link><description>arXiv:2601.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations are fundamental crystal defects whose stress fields govern a wide range of material properties. The analytical form of the stress tensor around single dislocation was established by elasticity theory more than 80 years ago and has provided a theoretical basis for evaluating essential characteristics of dislocations. However, direct experimental verification has long remained out of reach because it has been difficult to measure the components of the stress tensor with conventional methods. Here, we present the experimental visualization of the stress tensor around single dislocation in diamond. Using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, we mapped the shear components ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{yz}$, $\sigma_{zx}$) together with the trace of the stress tensor ($\sigma_{xx}+\sigma_{yy}+\sigma_{zz}$) around single 45{\deg} dislocation. The observed distributions exhibited good agreement with predictions from elasticity theory, thus providing experimental validation of this theoretical framework.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal History-Dependent Coalescence Mechanisms and Sintering Dynamics in Al-6.8%Cu Nanopowders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00492</link><description>arXiv:2601.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum-Copper (Al-Cu) alloys are essential materials for weight reduction critical structures in the aerospace and automotive industries, yet achieving their maximum ultrahigh-strength potential remains limited by nanoscale defect control during powder metallurgy processing. We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Al-6.8%Cu nanoparticles to explore atomic-scale mechanisms governing the full thermal sintering cycle. We demonstrate that while the sintering temperature primarily initiates neck formation, the subsequent cooling rate is the dominant kinetic parameter dictating the final microstructure. Fast cooling rates trap a significantly higher density of stacking faults and can unexpectedly lead to the formation of an amorphous phase at the interparticle interfaces, a feature critically dependent on the rate of thermal dissipation. We confirm a clear shift in the coalescence mechanism from plastic deformation (dislocation slip) at low temperatures (300 K and 450 K) to mass transport via atomic diffusion at high temperatures (600 K). These findings provide essential, atomic-scale guidelines for controlling thermal processing, particularly cooling rates, to design defect-stabilized, high-performance Al-Cu components.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00492v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Doping induced itinerant ferromagnetism and enhanced ferroelectricity in BL-InSe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00574</link><description>arXiv:2601.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in solids remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, with far-reaching implications for multifunctional materials and next-generation electronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict emergent sliding ferroelectricity and doping-mediated ferromagnetism in bilayer (BL) InSe. The energetically favored AB stacked BL-InSe spontaneously breaks the out-of-plane mirror symmetry, resulting in a switchable polarization with a saturated component of 0.089 pC/m and a low transition barrier of 28.8 meV per unit cell. Strikingly, low-concentration electrostatic doping enhances rather than suppresses the ferroelectric polarization due to the abnormal layer-dependent electronic occupation in BL-InSe, in contrast to the conventional screening paradigm. In addition, the characteristic Mexican-hat-shaped valence band enables doping-induced itinerant half-metallic ferromagnetism, where the interlayer spin density difference scales linearly with doping concentration and can be reversed by switching the polarization direction. These results demonstrate the coexistence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders in BL-InSe and establish a viable platform for realizing voltage-tunable multiferroicity through stacking and carrier doping in otherwise nonpolar and nonmagnetic semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00574v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link><description>arXiv:2601.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link><description>arXiv:2512.01884v6 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: A new computational framework is presented to predict the structural integrity of welds in hydrogen transmission pipelines. The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi liquids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982</link><description>arXiv:2207.11982v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum XY model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two-dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moir\'{e} twisted bi-layer graphene and bilayer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear-in-temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those caused by Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature-independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2207.11982v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hydrogen storage in pristine and Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers: electronic origins, coverage effects, and finite-temperature stability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16761</link><description>arXiv:2404.16761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present a systematic first-principles study of hydrogen adsorption on pristine and Janus MX2 and MSSe monolayers (M = Ni, Pd, Pt; X = S, Se), combining density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD). Orbital-resolved electronic-structure analysis reveals that hydrogen binding strength is controlled primarily by the contribution of metal d states near the Fermi level, which increases from Pd and Pt to Ni. Chalcogen substitution from S to Se further modulates adsorption by enhancing surface polarizability. Structure plays a decisive role: metallic 1T phases promote stronger single-molecule adsorption due to enhanced electronic screening, whereas the more open coordination of the 2H phase provides greater configurational freedom at high hydrogen coverage. Janus functionalization introduces chemically inequivalent S- and Se-terminated surfaces, leading to side-dependent adsorption energies, hydrogen-layer thicknesses, and spatial distributions. Hydrogen uptake remains dominated by molecular physisorption across all systems. Finite-temperature AIMD simulations at 300 K demonstrate that hydrogen remains molecular even at high loadings, with no dissociation or irreversible chemisorption. 2H-NiSSe and 2H-PdSSe exhibit the most favorable combination of moderate adsorption energies, stable multilayer hydrogen configurations, and robust thermal stability, whereas Pt-based Janus systems display strong confinement and reduced reversibility. These results establish clear design principles for hydrogen storage in TMDs, showing that optimal performance arises from intermediate physisorption rather than maximal binding strength and highlighting Janus Ni- and Pd-based systems as promising platforms for reversible molecular hydrogen storage.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.16761v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Redox Robust Mn(I/0/-I) Dicarbenes: Electrochemistry, Steric Mapping, and Borate-Directed C-C Bond Formation</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cznhs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Manganese is perhaps the most electronically versatile element, accessing eleven different formal oxidation states (-3 to +7). However, the redox properties and reactivities of low valent monometallic Mn(0) and Mn(-I) systems remain severely underexplored due to the propensity of Mn0 to dimerize and quench high-energy metalloradicals. We report a new series of redox active monometallic Mn(I), Mn(0) and Mn(-I) complexes containing a BH2-bridged dicarbene ligand coordinated to Mn, all which have been characterized using a suite of experimental and cutting-edge computational (DFT) methods. Slow electron transfer kinetics at Mn(I/0) are observed, with computations and electrochemical simulations in excellent agreement with experiment. Despite the lack of steric bulk at the BH2-bridged Mn(0), the tBu groups at the dicarbene provide sufficient steric protection to prevent dimerization, with percent buried volume (%V_bur) serving as a steric ranking tool for to predict whether Mn(0) complexes will remain monometallic in solution. We show that when %V_bur &gt; 83% prevents dimerization for a diverse array of of Mn(0) complexes from the literature. Ligand sterics of the BPh2-bridged and BH2 bridged complexes dictate reaction outcomes when Mn(I) and Mn(-I) are exposed to nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively, while the Mn(0) metalloradicals facilitate radical cycloisomerization catalysis of 6-iodo-1-hexene at room temperature. This work underscores the importance of ligand sterics in rationalizing reactivity patterns at Mn and offers valuable insights for designing chelating ligands that can selectively leverage  Mn(I/0/-I) states in redox-mediated reactions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cznhs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Accurate and Robust Prediction of Vertical Excitation Energies  with XYG3-Type Doubly Hybrid Density Functionals</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cx0jm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The XYG3-type doubly hybrid density functionals (xDHs) have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting ground-state energies and properties. However, until now, no method has been available to compute excited states with xDHs. In this work, we propose a method that combines the second order constricted variational density functional theory [CV(2)-DFT] within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and the configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles correction [CIS(D)] method to predict vertical excitation energies using xDHs. This new black-box method, dubbed TDA-xDH, has been benchmarked against a collective dataset of 410 excitation energies. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of xDHs. For local valence and Rydberg excitations represented by 352 benchmark data points, XYGJ-OS achieves a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.08 eV, outperforming the more expensive coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method (MAD = 0.11 eV). For 30 intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) excitations, XYGJ-OS also emerges as the best performer among tested functionals, with an MAD of 0.14 eV. Furthermore, XYGJ-OS exhibits excellent performance in predicting the 1La-1Lb gap for six linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), achieving an MAD of merely 0.01 eV. A case study on HAP-3MF further reveals that xDHs are able to correctly predict the inverted singlet-triplet gap. These results highlight the great promise of xDHs for accurately predicting a wide range of molecular excitation energies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-cx0jm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Perdeuteration of Arenes in Pharmaceuticals by SEAr Mechanism with Heavy Water Using pTSA Catalyst.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9fnfq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Aromatic rings are widely recognized in the realm of natural products and bioactive molecules, highlighting their importance in various applications. The development of deuterated analogues of pharmaceuticals is particularly significant in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this study, we present a novel catalytic method for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange in aromatic compounds, employing D2O as the deuterium source, which is not only easily accessible but also cost-effective. This approach demonstrates impressive deuterium incorporation under mild reaction conditions, yielding good to excellent results in a single run. Utilizing para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA) as a catalyst, this metal-free protocol exhibits broad applicability in the late-stage deuteration of a variety of bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals, and small molecules. Furthermore, our method is scalable; it has been successfully implemented at the gram-scale with a reduced catalyst loading of 2.0 mol% for Tyrosol, illustrating its practical utility. Moreover, our thorough mechanistic studies and detailed DFT studies enhance our understanding of how the catalyst and solvent contribute to the aromatic electrophilic substitution process. This innovative method provides a sustainable alternative to traditional transition metal-catalyzed H/D exchange techniques. It addresses key challenges such as the use of expensive metals, the risk of undesired reactions, and the need to remove metal impurities from products. Overall, this research enhances the efficiency and environmental friendliness of H/D exchange in aromatic compounds.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-9fnfq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Multiscale modelling of the electrocatalysis of enzymes: Insights into the performance of microperoxidase at an aqueous/graphene interface and their exploitation to improve performance</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qj5fh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>There is great interest in systems where enzymes are adsorbed on and act at electrode surfaces – enzymatic biofuel cells, bioreactors and biosensors are just three examples. Whilst such systems have been the subject of extensive study and development since the 1960s, the rate of progress in this research is hindered by a lack of molecular-level understanding of the enzyme adsorption process and adsorbed states, and the associated electron transfer processes. Herein, we present and then demonstrate a multiscale approach that combines molecular dynamics simulation to elucidate the former and density functional theory (MD/DFT) for the latter. The demonstration of the new approach focused on a system involving the microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) enzyme, a microenzyme made up of a Fe-containing heme ring attached to an 11-residue scaffold, a graphene electrode, and a neutral-pH saline solution. For this system, the adsorbed MP-11 was found to adopt six possible heme configurations, where the configurations are defined by the distance of the iron from the graphene and the angle between the normals of the heme ring and graphene electrode. The rate constant for electron transfer between the MP-11 and graphene evaluated through combining the MD and DFT results and their variation with overpotential are comparable to the limited experimental data.  The results were used to illustrate how the new multiscale approach could be used to improve electrocatalytic performance of the system.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qj5fh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Mild generation of highly nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbene boryl anion from neutral sp2-sp3 diboron reagents and its applications in nucleophilic borylation</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b6rqh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Due to its high activity, the synthesis or generation of the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) boryl anion remains challenging, with only limited methods available.

This less sterically hindered and strongly nucleophilic boryl anion demonstrates broad reactivity with diverse electrophiles, including those that are unreactive with other types of boryl anions or traditional diboron reagents. These nucleophilic borylation reactions enable the synthesis of a diverse array of four-coordinate organoboron compounds. Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm the intermediacy of the NHC boryl anion and provide clear insights into the reaction pathways for the newly discovered reactivities.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-b6rqh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

In this work, we introduce hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene (PS–OH) as a bifunctional ligand incorporated directly during CsPbBr3 PQD synthesis. The terminal -OH groups provide strong coordination to under-coordinated Pb2+ sites, suppressing non-radiative recombination, while the polystyrene backbone forms a protective hydrophobic shell. This dual action leads to substantially enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and substantially improved resistance to moisture-induced degradation. When used as a color-conversion layer on top of blue LEDs, the PS–OH modified PQDs enable more efficient photon down-conversion and improved device-level performance. These results demonstrate that functionalized polymers, employed as in-situ ligands, offer a powerful approach for stabilizing and enhancing brightness of perovskite quantum dots for advanced optoelectronic applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-hng84?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Meso-Substitution Controlled Synthesis of BODIPY–DPM Conjugates: A Pathway to Tailored Photophysical Properties</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0zz7t?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We show that the electronic nature of the meso-aryl substituent in 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl BODIPYs governs the reactivity of the 1,7-methyl (α-methyl) groups toward the Knoevenagel condensation. Reaction of pyrrole-2-aldehyde with electron-deficient 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-meso-pentafluorophenyl and 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-meso-4-nitrophenyl BODIPYs yields double condensation at the 1,7-methyl positions to give the corresponding bis(pyrrole) derivatives, whereas the electron-rich meso-tolyl analogue selectively undergoes single condensation at only one of the α-methyl groups under identical conditions. This substituent-dependent divergence extends to reactions with 1,9-diformyl-meso-aryl dipyrromethanes, enabling access to structurally distinct BODIPY–DPM conjugates. Reaction of 1,9-diformyl-DPM with meso-tolyl BODIPY selectively yields acyclic monosubstituted BODIPY–DPM conjugates, whereas the higher reactivity of meso-pentafluorophenyl BODIPY enables condensation between both 1,7-methyl groups and the two aldehyde functionalities of the diformyl-DPM scaffold, affording cyclic, porphyrin-like BODIPY–DPM frameworks. Notably, meso-pentafluorophenyl BODIPYs also undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the para-fluorine atom by piperidine under the condensation conditions, as confirmed unambiguously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The resulting BODIPY–DPM and BODIPY–pyrrole conjugates exhibit pronounced bathochromic shifts (90–180 nm relative to parent BODIPYs), deep-red to near-infrared absorption (~670 nm) and emission (~750 nm), enlarged Stokes shifts, and strong intramolecular charge-transfer character. These features translate into efficient heavy-atom-free triplet formation, with singlet-oxygen quantum yields reaching up to 0.45. A representative conjugate (10) exhibits potent photodynamic activity in B16F10 melanoma cells with minimal dark toxicity (IC₅₀ = 0.95 μM). TD-DFT analysis indicates that excited-state twisting reduces ΔEST, thereby facilitating heavy-atom-independent intersystem crossing. Collectively, these results establish a robust molecular design framework for next-generation heavy-atom-free photosensitizers.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0zz7t?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Elimination of wing tilt laterally overgrown GaN</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/011903/3376334/Elimination-of-wing-tilt-laterally-overgrown-GaN</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Wing tilt and associated defects at the coalescence boundary in GaN were completely eliminated in a maskless homoepitaxial overgrowth process, whereas SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-masked homoepitaxial overgrowth showed the same effects as samples grown on sapphire or SiC.

At optimal concentrations, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Qth&lt;/span&gt; decreases to 1.89 ± 0.059 mW⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanied by a prolonged carrier lifetime (17.7 ns), attributed to dual functional groups of IA passivating undercoordinated Pb defects. However, excess IA overcrowds surfaces of QDs, displacing OLA and creating new defects that increase &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Qth&lt;/span&gt;. These competing effects determine an optimal IA/OLA ratio for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Qth&lt;/span&gt; minimization, which is almost two orders of magnitude lower than in bulk materials. The suppressed hot carrier thermalization could significantly enhance the maximum achievable power conversion efficiency of HCSC. This work establishes the perovskite QDs as promising wide bandgap absorbers for HCSC and provides a ligand-engineering strategy to optimize hot carrier dynamics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/011904/3376101/Observation-of-the-slower-thermalization-process</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Defect dipole engineered hybrid polar configurations for high dielectric energy storage under low electric fields</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/013901/3376085/Defect-dipole-engineered-hybrid-polar</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Dielectric capacitors are vital components in advanced electronics and high-power electrical systems. A persistent challenge, however, is enhancing their energy density (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rec&lt;/sub&gt;) at low electric fields and voltages. Herein, we design a defect dipole engineered hybrid polar configuration to address this issue.

The coexistence of macro- and micro-domains in the optimal proportion improves interdomain interactions, effectively suppressing hysteresis while still retaining ferroelectric polarization. Meanwhile, the depolarization field generated by defect dipoles drives the aligned domains to revert to their initial disordered state. Together, this dual mechanism weakens remanent polarization (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), enabling the simultaneous reduction of energy loss (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;) and enhancement of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rec&lt;/sub&gt;.

In this study, an irradiation-hardened quasi-vertical GaN PiN diode with a beveled-mesa termination structure is fabricated, exhibiting only an 8% reduction in blocking voltage under 1.3 GeV Ta ion irradiation with a high fluence of ∼10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This robustness enables in-depth analysis of electrical degradation under the synergistic effects of irradiation and bias voltage. Forward &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; analysis reveals reductions in minority carrier lifetime, mobility, and diffusion length. Temperature-dependent reverse &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I–V&lt;/span&gt; characteristics show an upward shift in the transition voltage from variable range hopping leakage to space-charge-limited current conduction in irradiated devices, with additional involvement of trap-assisted Poole–Frenkel emission. deep-level transient spectroscopy identifies a shallow trap E2 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.1 eV) and two deep traps, E1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.43 eV) and H1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;v + 0.68 eV). E1 exhibits a twofold increase in trap density post-irradiation and is attributed to dislocation-related defects or Ga vacancies. H1 likely originates from dissociation of Mg–H complexes under irradiation, forming Mg&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt; and related complexes such as Mg&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. These traps, driven by the high electronic energy loss, could introduce localized recombination centers and scattering sites.

Although [6+4] pericyclic reactions of tropone derivatives and dienes have been investigated since the mid 1960s, little work has been performed to look at the factors that may affect the energy barriers of both the forward and reverse reaction. In this work, we use DFT calculations and experimental analyses to examine the cycloaddition reactions of tropone derivatives with dienes. We find that DFT calculations at the m062x-6-31G(d) level of theory are consistent with experimentally derived values of  ΔG‡ for the reactions of some tropone derivatives with cyclopentadiene. Likewise, calculations provide reasonable predictions of the distribution of [6+4] and competitive [4+2] adducts, with [6+4] adducts converting to the more stable [4+2] adducts at elevated temperatures. Finally, we observe that even the rather stable [4+2] adducts show some reversion to the starting tropone. Due to the alignment between calculations and experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data, this work highlights the value of employing DFT methods in the future to help in the design of new reversible cycloadditions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0bwtk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Modulating Polymorphic Phase Boundaries and Defect Chemistry in KNN-Based Piezoceramics Through Multi-Element Doping Strategies</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wfgdd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Lead-free potassium-sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO₃, KNN) ceramics represent a promising alternative to replace lead-based piezoelectrics in energy harvesting and actuator applications due to their high Curie temperature and favorable ferroelectric properties. This study investigates the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of pure KNN and multi-element doped compositions: (K0.4Na0.48Bi0.1La0.02)(Nb0.9Ti0.1)O3 (KNN-BiLaTi) and (K0.4Na0.56La0.02Y0.02)(Nb0.9V0.05Sb0.05)O3 (KNN-LaYVSb), synthesized via conventional solid-state methods. Structural analysis (XRD/Rietveld) revealed single-phase orthorhombic perovskite structures (space group Amm2) for all samples, with no detectable secondary phases. XPS, Raman, SEM, and TEM revealed that the dopants tune defect chemistry, suppress surface alkali degradation, and refine the microstructure, especially in dense, low-porosity KNN-LaYVSb, which has pronounced lattice distortion for favorable domain wall motion. Dielectric experiments demonstrated lower orthorhombic–tetragonal transition temperatures and wider, more diffuse phase transitions. However, Curie temperatures remained high, indicating reliable operation over a wide range of temperatures. At optimal poling, KNN-LaYVSb attained the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d₃₃ = 221 pC/N) and excellent thermal stability up to 275 °C, retaining over 90% of room-temperature value and over 80% at elevated temperatures near 450 °C. The improved temperature stability arises from diffuse phase transitions, defect-dipole stabilization, and nanoscale heterogeneity due to multi-element doping. The remnant polarization increased from 3.49 µC/cm² (Pure-KNN) to 25.3 µC/cm² (KNN-LaYVSb) with significantly reduced coercive field (6.10 kV/cm). These findings illustrate that selective multi-element co-doping at A- and B-sites effectively modifies polymorphic phase boundaries near room temperature by improving defect chemistry through controlled vacancy formation and optimizing microstructure. This results in robust, high-performance lead-free piezoceramics for advanced energy harvesting and sensing applications operating across wide temperature ranges.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wfgdd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Minding the Band gap: Major Factors for Correlating Computations with Experiments in Cu14 and Au20 Atomically Precise Nanoclusters</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-km72d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In a Perspective article titled "Mind the Gap!", Bredas clarifies the distinction between different uses of the term  "band gap" in the context of experimentally measured or computationally evaluated energy gaps. In view of the tremendous progress in atomically precise metal nanoclusters where electrochemical and optical energetics are routinely supported by computations to establish structure-function correlations, we explore the relationship between different protocols for measuring and computing band gaps of two distinct organic ligand-protected nanoclusters: [Cu14H10(MBN)3(PPh3)8]+ and Au20(TBBT)16. Through UV/visible spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, we measure optical and electrochemical band gaps in those systems. We then compare these experimental gaps to HOMO-LUMO gaps, fundamental gaps, vertical excitation energies, and Eox - Ered potentials computed using density functional theory (DFT) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). We test functionals with varying degrees of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange from 0% to 50%, different correlation functionals, basis sets, and (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) continuum solvation models. We find that in both copper and gold nanoclusters, the most important factor affecting the magnitude of the band gap is the % HF exchange, which in the case of the HOMO-LUMO gap can vary by several eV. This sensitivity is partially mitigated when computing the fundamental, optical, and electrochemical gaps. The second most important factor is the proper description of solvation effects. Other factors, such as the nature of the correlation functional, basis set, and geometry relaxation, have a considerably smaller effect on computed band gaps in these systems. Overall, this work provides generalizable guidelines on factors at varied importance for correlating computed and experimental "band gap" values.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-km72d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Materials: Table of Contents] Revisiting Ferroelectric‐Gated Phototransistors: A Tripartite Synapse‐Inspired Approach to In‐Sensor Image Processing (Adv.

Microcrystals</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3xz24?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>All-inorganic halide perovskites, especially CsPbBr3 microcrystals, are often considered to be 
optically stable and less defect-prone compared to their organometallic counterparts. 
Nevertheless, reports of photoluminescence (PL) blinking in bulk perovskite systems till date 
are restricted to organometallic halide perovskite nano-/microrods, leaving it an open question 
whether similar intermittency behaviour can be observed in all-inorganic halide perovskites of 
comparable dimensions. Intriguingly, we witnessed multi-level PL fluctuations (flickering) in 
individual green-emitting CsPbBr3 microrods. Wide-field PL microscopy reveals that the 
intensity fluctuations are nearly identical along the microrod, owing to charge carrier migration,  
and waveguide‑assisted propagation. Our measurements on single microrod suggests that the 
flickering dynamics is strongly influenced by excitation power, excitation energy, and local 
environmental constituents. Under dry argon environment, a sharp reduction in the PL intensity 
is observed, indicating the formation of large number of nonradiative (NR) centers which 
quenches all the photogenerated carriers, suppressing overall emission intensity and PL 
flickering. The exposure of oxygen passivates these NR traps generated under argon, while 
humidity introduces metastable photoinduced NR traps (“special quenchers”) that govern the 
enhanced flickering behaviours. Our findings establish that spatiotemporally correlated 
intermittency is not limited to organometallic perovskites but extends to all-inorganic 
perovskite bulk emitters as well and provides new insights into the role of transient defects and 
atmospheric constituents in dictating emission stability.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3xz24?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Magnesium-Catalysed, Hydroboration of C–C sigma-bonds of Benzylidene Cyclobutanes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-vqpmn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C–C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-vqpmn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Crystallization modulation for wide-bandgap perovskites with universal defect passivation toward efficient perovskite/organic tandem photovoltaics</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68125-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 03 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68125-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68125-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Defect formation and phase instability remain critical challenges for perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.

Here, we elucidate the electropolymerization-assisted polymerisation of carbazolyl Blatter radicals into thin films with nanometer-precision thickness control, as well as into free-standing thin films with the retained redox characteristics of Blatter radicals integrated within. Utilising the high chemical stability of Blatter radicals, terminal carbazole units were introduced on the 1,2,4-benzotriazinyl unit via Pd(0)-catalysed C-C coupling reaction, yielding new carbazolyl monomers Cz3N• and Cz2N•. Application of an oxidative potential of 1.5 V to monomers and varying the number of scans, enabled formation of polymer thin films, polyCz3N• and polyCz2N•, with a desired nanometer thickness (30-500 nm). Both monomers and polymers showed characteristic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and high redox reversibility associated with the Blatter radical. Density functional theory (DFT) indicated spin delocalisation on the 1,2,4-benzotriazinyl units and supported the experimental trends of optical properties (λ &gt; 500 nm), band gaps of Blatter radical monomers (2.33-2.48 eV) and polymer thin films (2.30-2.39 eV). Driven by strong π-π stacking interactions between 1,2,4-benzotriazinyl units in solid-state interactions, Cz3N• showed strong antiferromagnetic interactions with 2J/kB value of −53.16 K and a singlet–triplet energy gap of −0.1 kcal mol−1.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dxt0r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Among various implementations, FeFET-based physical reservoir computing systems are promising owing to the intrinsic nonlinearity and short-term memory of ferroelectric polarization and compatibility with standard CMOS technology. For analog signal applications, the method of converting input signals into gate voltage waveforms is critical to leverage the nonlinearity in ferroelectric polarization dynamics, since ferroelectric polarization dynamics are highly sensitive to applied voltage ranges. In this study, we experimentally examine how different voltage conversion methods influence the performance of FeFET-based RC systems. We first examine a conventional linear analog method, which linearly maps analog inputs to amplitudes of triangular voltage pulses. While simple, this method suffers from significant information loss due to insufficient polarization switching in the low-voltage region, leading to poor computational performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose split analog method, which introduces a voltage gap to exclude non-switching regions, ensuring that input pulses effectively activate ferroelectric dynamics across a wide input range. This method enables access to diverse polarization states by exploiting partial switching behavior. Our experiments demonstrate that split analog method significantly improves performance in input recall, delay, and time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, combining this method with a gate delay architecture enables high-accuracy prediction even in complex temporal tasks. These results highlight that the careful voltage waveform design transformed to the polarization dynamics is essential for fully leveraging the computational potential of FeFET-based RC systems in neuromorphic applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/1/011101/3375948/Efficient-harnessing-of-polarization-dynamics-in</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics] Atomic scale octahedral distortion and enhanced collective polarity underlying large polarization in ferroelectric perovskite oxides</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001492?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 31 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Materiomics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Xiali Liang, Jian Wang, Wanbiao Hu&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:36:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001492</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Many-electron characterizations of higher-charge superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23801</link><description>arXiv:2512.23801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of conventional superconductivity as the phonon-assisted formation and condensation of two-electron Cooper pairs is a significant triumph in condensed matter physics. Here, we propose many-electron characterizations of higher-charge superconductivity with Cooper pairs consisting of more than two electrons, by implementing translation symmetrization on parent pair-density-wave-ordered states. In particular, we demonstrate many-electron constructions with vanishing charge-2e sectors, but with sharp signatures in charge-4e or charge-6e expectation values instead. Such characterizations are consistent with previous phenomenology of vestigial order and Ginzburg-Landau theory, yet, instead of point-group-symmetry presumptions, we show that momentum conservation is both vital and sufficient. Our study thus offers a novel, general, and microscopic route to understand and characterize higher-charge superconductivity, including nontrivial experimental signatures such as fractional magnetic flux and period in interferometry, as well as localized Cooper pairs at lattice topological defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Competing Antiferromagnetic Phases in Multiferroic Wurtzite Transition-Metal Chalcogenides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23904</link><description>arXiv:2512.23904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics offers a pathway toward electrically controllable spin-based devices beyond ferromagnets. Here, we identify wurtzite MnX (X = S, Se, Te) as a family of multiferroic materials hosting competing AFM phases, including altermagnetic, where nonrelativistic spin splitting can be controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Using density-functional theory and atomistic spin-model calculations, we show that all pristine MnX compounds stabilize a stripe type collinear AFM ground state, contrary to earlier predictions of an altermagnetic ground state, with the magnetic order governed by frustrated Heisenberg and biquadratic exchange interactions. We further demonstrate that Cr doping drives a transition to an A-type AFM phase that breaks Kramers spin degeneracy and realizes a g-wave altermagnetic state with large nonrelativistic spin splitting near the Fermi level. Importantly, this spin splitting can be deterministically reversed by polarization switching, enabling electric-field control of altermagnetic electronic structure without reorienting the Neel vector or relying on spin-orbit coupling. The close energetic proximity of the stripe AFM to a noncollinear all-in-all-out configuration indicates that wurtzite MnX lies near a topological magnetic phase with finite scalar spin chirality, which may be stabilized by modest perturbations such as temperature, strain or chemical tuning. The distinct magnetic phases exhibit symmetry selective linear and non-linear Hall responses, providing direct transport signatures of altermagnetism and polarization control. Together, these results establish doped wurtzite MnX as a promising platform for altermagnet-ferroelectric multiferroics and electrically AFM spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Visualizing the dispersions of Fermi polaron and molecule via spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23918</link><description>arXiv:2512.23918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to measure the dispersions of Fermi polaron and molecule by engineering spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the impurity, which induces spin flip with finite momentum transfer. The polaron dispersion can be probed at small SOC momentum from the linear response of impurity spin. For molecule, we show that it can be prepared through an adiabatic steady-state evolution when setting SOC momentum as the Fermi momentum of majority bath. By gradually reducing SOC strength to zero, the steady state smoothly evolves to a molecular state with directional symmetry breaking. The corresponding dispersion can then be probed experimentally through the center-of-mass momentum distribution of molecules at finite density. Our scheme reveals a fundamental momentum difference between Fermi polaron and molecule, thereby offering a clear physical picture for their first-order transition in single-impurity system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23918v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlated 5f electronic states and phase stability in americium under high pressure: Insights from DFT+DMFT calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23963</link><description>arXiv:2512.23963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of americium (Am) across its four experimentally confirmed high-pressure phases Am-I (P63/mmc), Am-II (Fm-3m), Am-III (Fddd), and Am-IV (Pnma) up to 100 GPa, using density functional theory combined with embedded dynamical mean-field theory. Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit. Additionally, we demonstrate that the stability of the low-symmetry high-pressure phases (Am-III and Am-IV) is governed by a Peierls-like distortion mechanism, which reduces the total energy through symmetry-lowering lattice distortions accompanied by electronic reconstruction. This study offers a new microscopic perspective on high-pressure phase transitions and emergent quantum phenomena in actinide materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theoretical Insights into Excitons, Optical Properties, and Nonradiative Recombination Dynamics in M$_6$CSe$_4$ (M = Ca, Sr) Antiperovskite Carbides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24093</link><description>arXiv:2512.24093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically predicted antiperovskite carbides M$_6$CSe$_4$ (M = Ca, Sr) represent an emerging class of optoelectronic materials with potential relevance for photovoltaic applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties, together with non-radiative recombination dynamics. Density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (GW) reveal that both compounds are direct band gap semiconductors with gaps spanning the infrared-visible region. Incorporating electron-hole interactions via the Bethe-Salpeter equation leads to pronounced red-shifts in the first peak of optical spectra, indicative of bound excitons with binding energies of 0.12 eV (Ca$_6$CSe$_4$) and 0.20 eV (Sr$_6$CSe$_4$), extending over nearly three unit cells in all directions. Time-dependent DFT combined with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K reveals pronounced lattice fluctuations in Ca$_6$CSe$_4$, resulting in 38% larger band gap variations and 28% faster electronic decoherence. Together with 53% weaker nonadiabatic couplings, these effects yield non-radiative recombination lifetimes approximately eleven times longer than in Sr$_6$CSe$_4$. Overall, our results identify M$_6$CSe$_4$ carbides as promising lead-free photovoltaic materials, with Ca$_6$CSe$_4$ exhibiting superior optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics that motivate further experimental investigation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-scale visualization of d-wave altermagnetism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24114</link><description>arXiv:2512.24114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture. Our work provides the foundational real-space evidence for altermagnetism, moving the field from theoretical and momentum-space probes to direct visual confirmation; thereby opening a path to explore how this unconventional magnetic order couples to and controls other quantum electronic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Increased Covalence and V-center mediated Dark Fenton-Like Reactions in V-doped TiO2: Mechanisms of Enhanced Charge-Transfer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24219</link><description>arXiv:2512.24219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the valence state and electronic structure of catalytically active sites is crucial for improving Fenton and Fenton-like reactions, which rely on the efficient activation of the H2O2 molecule. Pure TiO2, however, has inadequate activity towards the H2O2 activation and is often constrained by the intrinsic electronic limitations of pristine TiO2. Herein, a rational approach has been demonstrated to improve the Fenton-like catalytic performance of TiO2 through multivalent vanadium (V) doping. A comprehensive characterization using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that V incorporation substantially alters the electronic structure of TiO2. The DFT results, supported by experimental data, indicate that V doping enhances Ti-O covalence and introduces mid-gap states, resulting in a reduced band gap and improved charge transfer. XPS confirms the coexistence of multiple oxidation states of V, which serve as active centres for activating H2O2 and generating OH radicals. As a result, V-doped TiO2 exhibits significantly enhanced dark-catalytic activity in degrading the organic dye Rhodamine B (RhB). Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into multivalent-cation-induced valence state and electronic structure modulation in TiO2, offering a promising strategy for designing high-performance catalysts via defect engineering for sustainable environmental remediation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Using Particle Shape to Control Defects in Colloidal Crystals on Spherical Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24399</link><description>arXiv:2512.24399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical particles confined to a sphere surface cannot pack densely into a hexagonal lattice without defects. In this study, we use hard particle Monte Carlo simulations to determine the effects of continuously deformable shape anisotropy and underlying crystal lattice preference on inevitable defect structures and their distribution within colloidal assemblies of hard rounded polyhedra confined to a closed sphere surface. We demonstrate that cube particles form a simple square assembly, overcoming lattice/topology incompatibility, and maximize entropy by distributing eight three-fold defects evenly on the sphere. By varying particle shape smoothly from cubes to spheres we reveal how the distribution of defects changes from square antiprismatic to icosahedral symmetry. Congruent studies of rounded tetrahedra reveal additional varieties of characteristic defect patterns within three, four, and six-fold symmetric lattices. This work has promising implications for programmable defect generation to facilitate different vesicle buckling modes using colloidal particle emulsions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Wafer-Scale Integration of Piezo- and Ferroelectric Al0.64Sc0.36N Thin Films by Reactive Sputtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24455</link><description>arXiv:2512.24455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-area deposition of Aluminium-Scandium-Nitride (Al1-xScxN) thin films with higher Sc content (x) remains challenging due to issues such as abnormal orientation growth, stress control, and the undesired crystal phase. These anomalies across the wafer hinder the development of high scandium-content AlScN films, which are critical for microelectromechanical systems applications. In this study, we report the sputter deposition of Al0.64Sc0.36N thin films from a 300 mm Al0.64Sc0.36 alloy target on 200 mm Si(100) wafers, achieving an exceptionally high deposition rate of 8.7 {\mu}m/h with less than 1% AOGs and controllable stress tuning. Comprehensive microstructural and electrical characterizations confirm the superior growth of high-quality Al0.64Sc0.36N films with exceptional wafer-average piezoelectric coefficients (d33,f =15.62 pm/V and e31,f = -2.9 C/m2) owing to low point defects density and grain mosaicity. This was accomplished through the implementation of an optimized seed layer and a refined electrode integration strategy, along with optimal process conditions. The wafer yield and device failure rates are analysed and correlated with the average stress of the films and their stress profiles along the diameter. The resulting films show excellent uniformity in structural, compositional, and piezoelectric properties across the entire 200 mm wafer, underscoring their strong potential for next-generation MEMS applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24455v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Origins of spontaneous magnetic fields in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24585</link><description>arXiv:2512.24585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the broken time reversal symmetry (BTRS) state in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ remains elusive, and its relation to superconductivity remains controversial. There are various universal predictions for the BTRS state when it is associated with a multicomponent superconducting order parameter. In particular, in the BTRS superconducting state, spontaneous fields appear around crystalline defects, impurities, superconducting domain walls and sample surfaces. However, this phenomenon has not yet been experimentally demonstrated for any BTRS superconductor. Here, we aimed to verify these predictions for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by performing muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$ single crystals at ambient pressure and stoichiometric Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under hydrostatic pressure. The study allowed us to conclude that spontaneous fields in the BTRS superconducting state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ appear around non-magnetic inhomogeneities and, at the same time, decrease with the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$. The observed behaviour is consistent with the prediction for multicomponent BTRS superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. The results of the work are relevant to understanding BTRS superconductivity in general, as they demonstrate, for the first time, the relationship among the superconducting order parameter, the BTRS transition, and crystal-structure inhomogeneities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24585v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disentangle Intertwined Interactions in Correlated Charge Density Wave with Magnetic Impurities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24668</link><description>arXiv:2512.24668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in strongly correlated electronic systems serve as sensitive probes to a wide range of many-body quantum phenomena. Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind such site-specific interactions have been poorly understood. Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mobility-induced phase separation in a binary mixture of active Brownian particles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24761</link><description>arXiv:2512.24761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report a Brownian dynamics simulation of the mobility-induced phase separation which occurs in a two-dimensional binary mixture of active soft Brownian particles, whose interactions are modeled by non-additive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potentials inspired in Lennard-Jones potentials used for glass-forming passive mixtures. The analysis of structural properties, such as the radial distribution functions and the hexatic order parameter, shows that the high-density coexisting state in the binary case is spatially disordered, unlike the solid-like state observed for the monocomponent system. Characterization of the mean-square displacement of the active particles shows that both the low- and high-density coexisting states have diffusive behavior for long times. Thus, the high-density coexisting states are liquid-like in the binary cases. Moreover, diffusive behavior is also observed in the high-density solid-like state for the monocomponent system, which is driven by the presence of active topological defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Melting curve of correlated iron at Earth's core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25061</link><description>arXiv:2512.25061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable constraints on iron's melting curve at Earth's inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link><description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of First-Principles Methods in Modeling the Melting Properties of Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23940</link><description>arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Configurational-entropy-driven structural and optical stability in high-entropy halide perovskites for broadband NIR photonics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24328</link><description>arXiv:2512.24328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By injecting configurational entropy into soft ionic lattices, high-entropy halide perovskites offer a compelling route toward photonic materials that are both functionally rich and operationally robust; however, converting compositional complexity into predictable optical function remains challenging. Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TLS-induced thermal nonlinearity in a micro-mechanical resonator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24539</link><description>arXiv:2512.24539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of a thermally-driven amplitude-frequency nonlinearity in a thin-film quartz phononic crystal resonator at millikelvin temperatures. The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Imaging nanoscale photocarrier traps in solar water-splitting catalysts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24543</link><description>arXiv:2512.24543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects trap photocarriers and hinder solar water splitting. The nanoscale photocarrier transport, trapping, and recombination mechanisms are usually inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements and remain elusive. Because an individual high-performing nanoparticle photocatalyst may outperform the ensemble average, design rules that would otherwise enhance catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Investigation of resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au using Reactive Molecular Dynamics and ab-initio quantum transport calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11437</link><description>arXiv:2407.11437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the underlying physical mechanism for electric-field induced resistive switching in Au/MoS2/Au based memristive devices by combining reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) and ab-initio quantum transport calculations. Using MD with Au/Mo/S ReaxFF potential, we observe the formation of realistic conductive filament consisting of gold atoms through monolayer MoS2 layer when sufficient electric field is applied. We furthermore instigate the rupture of the gold atom filament when a sufficiently large electric field is applied in the opposite direction. To calculate the conductance of the obtained structures and identify the High Resistance (HR) and Low Resistance (LR) states, we employ the ab-initio electron transport calculations by importing the atomic structures from MD calculations. For single-defect MoS2 memristors, the obtained LRS, HRS current densities are in order of 10^7 A/cm^2 which agrees reasonably well with the reported experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.11437v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of Quasi-Quantum Hall Effect and Coulomb Disorder in Semimetals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05273</link><description>arXiv:2412.05273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low carrier densities in topological semimetals (TSMs) enable the exploration of novel magnetotransport in the quantum limit (QL). Recent findings consistent with 3D quasi-quantum Hall effect (QQHE) have positioned TSMs as promising platforms for exploring 3D quantum Hall transport, but the lack of tunability in the Fermi level has thus far limited the ability to observe a QQHE signal. Here, we tune the defect concentrations in the Dirac semimetal Cd${}_3$As${}_2$ to achieve ultra-low carrier concentrations at 2 K around $2.9\times10^{16}$cm${}^{-3}$, giving way to QQHE signal at modest fields near 10 T. At low carrier densities, where QQHE is most accessible, we find that clear QQHE is obscured by a carrier density dependent background originating from Coulomb disorder from charged point defects and Landau level broadening. Our results highlight the interplay between QQHE and Coulomb disorder, demonstrating that clear observation of QQHE in TSMs intricately depends on Fermi level and disorder magnitudes. We find that Coulomb disorder, as theoretically predicted, is an essential ingredient for understanding the magnetoresistivity for a spectrum of Fermi levels in Cd${}_3$As${}_2$, anchoring the role of defects and charged disorder in TSM applications. We discuss future constraints and opportunities in exploring 3D QQHE and quantum Hall effects in TSMs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.05273v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced negative capacitance in La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ ferroelectric capacitor from tuning of bias voltage pulse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23448</link><description>arXiv:2507.23448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a remarkable bias voltage dependent specific negative capacitance in multidomain La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ (PLZT) ferroelectric capacitors. The specific negative capacitance maximizes at a specific bias voltage because of emergence of maximum domain-wall density during ``switching" of the domains. Domain configuration changes from such an ``optimum" state if higher or lower bias voltage is applied at a much faster or slower rate. Phase-field simulation using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation corroborates the experimental results and shows dependence of the domain-wall length during switching on the bias voltage amplitude and its maximization at a specific bias voltage amplitude. Interestingly, the radius of curvature of the resulting polarization ($P$) versus voltage ($V$) hysteresis loop at the coercive voltage ($V_C$), as well, turns out to be depending on the bias voltage. All these results indicate a close correlation among the bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and time scale), domain-wall length during switching, shape of the resulting ferroelectric hysteresis loop, and the transient negative capacitance. It may have important ramifications both in the context of physics behind negative capacitance in a multidomain ferroelectric capacitor and devices being developed by exploiting its advantages.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23448v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transient Absorption Spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19188</link><description>arXiv:2510.19188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NbOI$_2$ has recently emerged as a new van der Waals material combining semiconducting behavior with intrinsic in plane ferroelectricity and pronounced transport and optical anisotropy. However, its photocarrier dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here we report transient absorption spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$ using femtosecond pump probe reflectance measurements. A pronounced transient absorption feature is observed near the 2.34 eV excitonic resonance, arising from photocarrier induced excitonic energy shifts and saturation. The decay dynamics reveal an exciton lifetime of several tens of picoseconds and show density-dependent behavior consistent with exciton exciton annihilation and defect-assisted Auger recombination, yielding a rate of 0.4 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Polarization resolved measurements further reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy in the transient response that follows the linear absorption anisotropy. These findings provide fundamental insight into photocarrier dynamics in NbOI$_2$ and establish key parameters for understanding and exploiting its optoelectronic behavior.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.19188v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Partially polaron-transformed quantum master equation for exciton and charge transport dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02812</link><description>arXiv:2203.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaron-transformed quantum master equation (PQME) offers a unified framework to describe the dynamics of quantum systems in both limits of weak and strong couplings to environmental degrees of freedom. Thus, PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. A formal framework to address this issue is developed in the present work by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a 2nd order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model of two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with test calculations focused on those due to homogeneous relaxation terms, demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of the present approach.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2203.02812v3</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: eScience] Modulation of electron delocalization and localization induced by single-atom alloys on defective H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3−y&lt;/sub&gt; for boosting photocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide to ammonia</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725001594?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 30 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; eScience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Haibo Yin, Haiwei Su, Hua Zhao, Chao He, Tianchang Lei, Xiaoguang Zhao, Yakun Qu, Weizhen Ye, Yu Wu, Xing Yuan, Yunlong Wang, Yuan Li, Junting Wang, Gaoke Zhang, Junhua Li&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: eScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:25:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725001594</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today Physics] Defect Engineering Enables Ultra-Stable Radiation-resistant Optical Transparency in Polycrystalline Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; Ceramics</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529325003657?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 31 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Materials Today Physics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Lexing Liang, Cong Zhang, Mao Deng, Junjing Duan, Xiaolan Zhou, Zaixin Wei, Kailei Lu, Yanli Shi, Zhangyi Huang, Jianqi Qi, Tiecheng Lu&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today Physics</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:25:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529325003657</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics] One-step sintering enabled structural stability and defect suppression even in Fe-off-stoichiometric BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; piezoceramics</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001480?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 30 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Materiomics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Shiyuan Zhang, Xingyuan Qi, Jinhao Hu, Xianxin Zhang, Mengping Xue, Bo-Ping Zhang&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:36:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847825001480</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Boosting electrical breakdown strength in sodium bismuth titanate based relaxor ferroelectric ceramics by constructing composite structure for energy storage</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25049175?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 146&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Yunxuan Xu, Xuhai Shi, Zong-Yang Shen, Dong-Xu Li, Jiamou Wu, Wenqin Luo&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:36:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25049175</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

For reaction barriers and water clusters, some of us earlier found that HF-DFT succeeds not because the HF density is accurate, but due to cancellation of negative functional-driven error (FE) by positive density-driven error (DE). Since DE, as defined here, is biased toward the self-consistent DFA density and against the HF density, the DE of the HF density is referred to as non-variational density over-localization (NVDO). In this work, we show that interaction energy errors in halogen- and chalcogen-bonded complexes in the B30 data set are not dominated by density-driven error. Instead, HF-DFT again succeeds through FE–DE cancellation. Benchmark Kohn–Sham inversions of coupled-cluster densities for NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF, Cl-…SF2, Cl-...SCF2, and Cl-…PF3 provide strong evidence for this cancellation. For additional complexes, we employ the long-range-corrected hybrid LCωPBE as a proxy for electron-transfer errors in the exact density. We also examine several self-interaction correction (SIC) methods and find significant improvement from FLOSIC. We point out common features of the density errors in the NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF complexes and three transition states, arguing that significant density-driven errors of energy arise only from electron-transfer errors. We also highlight a common feature in our present and previous work: long bonds can lead to non-negligible functional-driven self-interaction error of the energy from otherwise-accurate semi-local functionals in transition states, water clusters, and halogen or chalcogen bonds.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-wfft9-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Thiol-bearing tertiary alkylammonium chloride for regulation of PbI2 excess in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>One of the key strategies for record photovoltaic efficiencies in metal halide perovskite solar cells is the addition of PbI2 excess in a stoichiometric perovskite solution which controls crystallization, passivates defects and induces a preferred orientation in the perovskite layer. However, residual PbI2, typically found in the perovskite layer after crystallization, generates non-radiative recombination centres and promotes ion migration under light and heating stress, thus accelerating performance loss. To mitigate the above issues, a common strategy is the post-deposition of organic ammonium salts which interact in situ with residual PbI2. Here, we adopt a multifunctional alkylammonium salt, 2-diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride (DEAET), in which both the thiol (–SH) and protonated tertiary amine groups can strongly bind to PbI₂. Upon deposition of DEAET on top of FAPbI3 film, we show that DEAT decreases the percentage of residual PbI2 by 40% and totally eliminates Pb0. These two effects lead to enhanced radiative recombination, proving a net passivation effect, while chemical analysis (FTIR and liquid-state NMR) explains that this is due to strong interactions between tertiary protonated ammonium (-NH+) and thiol (-SH) groups of DEAT with under-coordinated Pb2+. The stabilization of FAPbI3 black phase along with the establishment of a solid barrier to impede the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite layer over time lead to enhanced operational stability for the as-fabricated solar cells. The encouraging findings of this study lay the foundation for the utilization of tertiary ammonium thiol-based salts as efficient agents for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Hot-Carrier Injection and Millisecond Charge Separation From a Robust Heteroleptic Iron(II) Chromophore Immobilized on TiO2</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tg48m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, computational analysis, and photoelectrochemical behavior of a new iron-based chromophore, [(Cpy)2Fe(deeb)](PF6)2 (Fe(Cpy)2(deeb)), where Cpy is 1- methyl-3-(2-pyridyl)imidazole and deeb is 4,4’-(CO2CH2CH3)2-2,2’-bipyridine, is reported. Electrochemically reversible waves assigned to a metal-centered Eo(FeIII/II) = +0.48 and a ligand- centered E(0)(Fe2+/+) = -1.47 V vs Fc+/0 reduction were evident in cyclic voltammetry measurements. The combination of a strong -donor and a -acceptor lowered the energy of the metal-to-ligand charge- transfer (MLCT) excited state relative to the metal-centered state. Two MLCT transitions appear in the visible region at 424 nm and 580 nm. DFT calculations revealed that the lower-energy band was well formulated as Fe(II)→deeb and the higher-energy transition was charge transfer to both the deeb and Cpy ligands. Resonance Raman spectroscopy supports these findings showing enhanced deeb vibrational modes with 532 nm excitation, both deeb and Cpy modes with 473 nm excitation, and exclusively Cpy with 405 nm excitation. Ultrafast spectroscopy reveals a short-lived (~2 ps) MLCT excited state and a longer-lived (~20 ps) metal-centered state. Efficient methods to deprotect the ester groups and anchor the complex to mesoporous TiO2 (anatase) thin films in high surface coverages, Fe(Cpy)2(dcb)|TiO2  = 3 x 10-8 mol/cm2, were established. Pulsed light excitation of Fe(Cpy)2(dcb)|TiO2 resulted in rapid excited state injection (kinj &gt; 108 s-1) and formation of a charge- separated state, FeIII(Cpy)2(dcb)|TiO2(e-), which persists on the millisecond time scale before returning cleanly to the ground state with second-order kinetics. Injection yields measured 50 ns after light excitation were found to double from  [PHI] = 0.15 with green (532 nm) light to [PHI] = 0.30 with blue (457 nm) light excitation. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (% IPCE) measurements as a function of excitation wavelength in a 0.5 M LiI/I2/CH3CN electrolyte provide clear evidence for band-selective 1 ‘hot carrier’ injection from the remote Cpy-localized excited state. Collectively, the spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical data indicate that a semiconductor can intercept hot electrons even when the excited-state dipole is oriented away from the surface-anchoring ligand.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tg48m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Shortcomings of Linear-Response TD-DFT for ESA Oscillator Strength Calculations</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770/asset/images/medium/ct5c01770_0004.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:06:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01770</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Electronic and Geometric Symmetry in Chalcogen-Bonded Telluronium Cations Revealed by 125Te NMR and DFT</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552/asset/images/medium/jp5c05552_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry C&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:28:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c05552</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Defect-Assisted Recombination in Semiconductors and Photovoltaic Device Parameters from First Principles</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12981</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c12981/asset/images/medium/ja5c12981_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c12981&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:03:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12981</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22321v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A scanning probe microscopy approach for identifying defects in aluminum oxide</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22369</link><description>arXiv:2512.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hf/Zr Superlattice-Based High-\k{appa} Gate Dielectrics with Dipole Layer Engineering for Advanced CMOS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22505</link><description>arXiv:2512.22505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced logic transistors require gate dielectrics that achieve sub-nanometer equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), suppress leakage, and satisfy three key requirements: (i) compatibility with RMG-like high-temperature processing, (ii) sufficient Vth tunability for multi-Vth design, and (iii) high device reliability. However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Myofibroblasts slow down defect recombination dynamics in mixed cell monolayers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22923</link><description>arXiv:2512.22923v1 Announce Type: new

Inspired by the analogy between liquid crystals and cells, we investigate how topological defects influence reorganization in dense monolayers of co-cultured fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Owing to steric interactions, these elongated cells exhibit local order; topological defects, where alignment is disrupted, have been postulated to serve as mechanical centers. In this study, we examine how the incorporation of contractile myofibroblasts impacts defect relaxation. The behavior is reminiscent of active nematics with quenched disorder: myofibroblast concentration modulates the disorder strength; increasing their fraction slows defect recombination. Higher myofibroblast concentrations similarly reduce the overall cell alignment on microgrooved surfaces, as myofibroblasts interfere with monolayer reorganization. This observation highlights the potential of a simple, quantitative assay for diagnosing disease progression. Furthermore, we found that myofibroblasts preferentially localize at negatively charged -1/2 defects, compared to fibroblasts, which tend to be localized in +1/2 defects. Consequently, the slowdown of recombination dynamics can be partially attributed to the reduced velocity of the more mobile +1/2 defects. Our study suggests that myofibroblasts can exploit negatively charged defects by avoiding regions of compressive stress and evading apoptosis. Combining live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence studies, this work provides insights into the role of topological defects in fibrotic disease progression.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fast and accurate Fe-H machine-learning interatomic potential for elucidating hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22934</link><description>arXiv:2512.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22934v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Simple and Efficient Non-DFT-Based Machine Learning Interatomic Potential to Simulate Titanium MXenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23063</link><description>arXiv:2512.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Compositional and Oxygen-Vacancy Effects on Phase Stability and Electronic Properties in Ceria-Based Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23120</link><description>arXiv:2512.23120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerium-based lanthanide high-entropy oxides (LN-HEOs) are promising candidates for solid-state electrolyte (mass transport) applications due to their ability to accommodate high concentrations of oxygen vacancies while retaining a fluorite-derived structure. However, synthesis often yields undesired ordered oxygen-deficient phases, such as bixbyite, depending on composition and processing conditions. We utilize first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate phase stability in the model system Ce$_x$(YLaPrSm)$_{1-x}$O$_{2-\delta}$, with the aim of elucidating the thermodynamic factors governing fluorite-bixbyite competition and identifying structure-property relationships to oxygen transport. By independently varying cerium concentration and oxygen vacancy content, we predict that the transition from disordered fluorite to ordered bixbyite is driven primarily by compositional and vacancy-ordering effects, rather than through changes in cation valence. Free-energy analysis reveals that at high vacancy concentrations, bixbyite is enthalpically favored due to ordered oxygen vacancies, while fluorite is stabilized at lower vacancy concentrations and higher cerium content through configurational entropy of the anion sublattice. These DFT results clarify the competing energetic contributions that control phase stability and structure-valence relationships in LN-HEOs and establishes a mechanistic framework for designing vacancy-tolerant oxide electrolytes with tunable phase behavior.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23120v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of robust one-dimensional edge channels in a three-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23277</link><description>arXiv:2512.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link><description>arXiv:2512.23364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23364v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Operando study of the evolution of peritectic structures in metal solidification by quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23501</link><description>arXiv:2512.23501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 {\deg}C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exploring phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals using liquid-phase TEM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23588</link><description>arXiv:2512.23588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) and their nanocomposites are driving the next generation of photonic applications. Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23706</link><description>arXiv:2512.23706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23706v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On Gauging Finite Symmetries by Higher Gauging Condensation Defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22440</link><description>arXiv:2512.22440v1 Announce Type: cross

We also study the symTFT implications of these effective Lagrangians and clarify their relations with higher group global symmetries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Noise Spectroscopy of Nanoscale Charge Defects in Silicon Carbide at Room Temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22521</link><description>arXiv:2512.22521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nanoscale charge environment critically influences semiconductor physics and device performance. While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent democratizes access to state-of-the-art computational methodologies, accelerating hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton pairs coupled via the long-living phonons and their superfluorescent markers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link><description>arXiv:2501.16874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.16874v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link><description>arXiv:2509.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14762v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link><description>arXiv:2512.21049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like oscillatory statistics can also arise from a purely local dynamical mechanism, revealed using a minimal Lorenz model description of a walking droplet viewed as an active particle with internal degrees of freedom. A localized defect directly perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This work opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs by revealing how quantum-like statistics can emerge from local internal-state dynamics of active particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21049v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PhononBench:A Large-Scale Phonon-Based Benchmark for Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21227</link><description>arXiv:2512.21227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

Counterion and metal comparisons show that chloride is uniquely enabling and that the nickel analog is markedly less active. DFT calculations, supported by microkinetic modeling, rule out isonitrile-induced chloride migration from palladium to bismuth, and instead identify a cooperative pathway in which chloride-assisted enolate formation, concerted C–C and C–O bond formation, and subsequent release of an N,O-carbene collectively determine reactivity, with carbene tautomerization to the oxazoline product constituting the overall rate-limiting event.

Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler–Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance.

As the chemical potentials of O and Se increase to moderate levels, the concentrations of  VO+ and  VSe+ drop, shifting the Fermi level down to the CBM and triggering the MIT.

This work aims to systematically investigate the evolution of polarization switching mechanisms in AlScN thin films during bipolar electrical cycling, and to reveal the potential microstructural origins of the observed fatigue behavior. The switching dynamics were characterized using transient current integration measurements at various electric fields after different cycle numbers.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic polarons are self trapped states of an electron in a locally spin polarised environment. They occur close to the magnetic $T_c$ in low carrier density local moment magnets when the electron-spin coupling is comparable to the hopping scale. In non disordered systems the primary signatures are a modest non-monotonicity in the temperature dependent resistivity $\rho(T)$, and a magnetoresistance that can be $\sim 20-30 \%$ at $T_c$, at fields that, in energy units, are $\sim 0.01 k_BT_c$. We find that structural disorder, in the form of pinning centers, promotes polaron formation, hugely increases the resistivity peak at $T_c$, and can enhance the magnetoresistance to $\sim 80\%$. The change in magnetoresistance with disorder is, however, non-monotonic. Too much disorder just creates an Anderson insulator - with the resistivity unresponsive to the magnetisation. This paper establishes the optimum disorder for maximising the magnetoresistance, suggests the physical process behind the unusual disorder dependence, and provides a magnetoresistance map - in terms of coupling and disorder - that locates some of the existing magnetic semiconductors within this framework.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonvolatile Electrical Control of Spin via Sliding Fractional Quantum Multiferroics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21559</link><description>arXiv:2512.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fractionally quantized polarization induced by interlayer sliding in bilayer altermagnets, unveiling a previously unrecognized multiferroic phase termed sliding fractional quantum multiferroicity (SFQM). This unconventional magnetic phase uniquely integrates sliding ferroelectricity with fractional quantum ferroelectricity, enabling highly efficient switching and nonvolatile electrical control of spin.~Unlike conventional multiferroics, SFQM simultaneously exhibits lattice-scale atomic displacements, ultralow switching barriers, and spin splitting, giving rise to a large fractionally quantized polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify bilayer altermagnet Ca(CoN)$_2$ and its family materials as promising candidates hosting SFQM. In contrast to gate-controlled schemes, the spin-layer coupling in SFQM is intrinsically induced by spontaneous electrical and layer polarization, requiring no sustained gate field and exhibiting nonvolatile character. This mechanism enables nonvolatile electrical control of spin through biaxial sliding, where displacements along the \textit{x}- and \textit{y}-axes generate opposite polarization directions in the layer-dependent electrical polarization. Furthermore, SFQM exhibits a fully switchable anomalous Hall effect and a pronounced magneto-optical response, which can be utilized for its detection and distinction. These findings highlight the promising role of sliding-mediated couplings among unconventional magnetism, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, and stacking order in realizing electrically controllable two-dimensional multiferroics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Origin of Organic Magnetoresistance Using Time-Domain Magnetic Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21629</link><description>arXiv:2512.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic Magnetoresistance is defined as the change of resistance in an organic material, such as a conducting polymer, as a function of an imposed magnetic field. We demonstrate this effect in a Polypyrrole/ Polydimethylsiloxane complex by using a novel magnetic pulse system. The frequency spectrum of the current flowing through the sample reveals equally spaced reversed peaks in the current. We show that these peaks happen at the Lamour frequency for the dominant charge carrier of the system, namely polarons. This posits the origin Organic magnetoresistance as simple Rabi Oscillations rather than mechanisms based of bipolaron formation and singlet-triplet conversions. We directly estimate the effective polaronic mass in this complex. A semi classical theoretical approach is suggested to explain this effect as direct spin flipping in a time transient magnetic field. This is the first time that such an experimental approach has been applied in this field and the first time the effective polaronic mass has been measured in a conducting polymer.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linear Foundation Model for Quantum Embedding: Data-Driven Compression of the Ghost Gutzwiller Variational Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21666</link><description>arXiv:2512.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of quantum matter rely mainly on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), which often fails for strongly correlated systems. Quantum embedding (QE) theories address this limitation by mapping the system onto an auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) describing fragment-environment interactions, but the EH is typically large and its iterative solution is the primary computational bottleneck. We introduce a linear foundation model for QE that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the space of quantum states needed to solve the EH within a small variational subspace. Using a data-driven active-learning scheme, we learn this subspace from EH ground states and reduce each embedding solve to a deterministic ground-state eigenvalue problem in the reduced space. Within the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (ghost-GA), we show for a three-orbital Hubbard model that a variational space learned on a Bethe lattice is transferable to square and cubic lattices without additional training, while substantially reducing the cost of the EH step. We further validate the approach on plutonium, where a single variational space reproduces the energetics of all six crystalline phases while reducing the cost of the EH solution by orders of magnitude. This provides a practical route to overcome the main computational bottleneck of QE frameworks, paving the way for high-throughput ab initio simulations of strongly correlated materials at a near-DFT cost.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21666v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect Engineering for Stabilizing Magnetic and Topological Properties in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21680</link><description>arXiv:2512.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 is a versatile platform for exploring diverse topological quantum states, yet its potential is hampered by intrinsic antisite defects. While Sb substitution has been employed to tune the Fermi level towards the charge neutral point, it exacerbates the formation of Mn-Sb antisite defects. Here, we address this challenge by combining first-principles calculations with strategic synthesis to systematically investigate and control antisite defects in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4. Our calculations reveal that increasing antisite defect density progressively destroys the field-forced magnetic Weyl state, eventually driving the system into a trivial magnetic insulator. Motivated by these findings, we develop an optimized chemical vapor transport method, yielding high-quality Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 crystals with significantly reduced antisite defect density. The emergence of strong Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the forced ferromagnetic state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect near charge neutrality, with opposite signs for n- and p-type samples, confirms the type-II Weyl semimetal nature. These findings underscore the critical role of antisite defects in determining the magnetic and topological properties of Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 and establish defect engineering via optimized synthesis as a crucial strategy for realizing its exotic magnetic topological states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum tunneling and defect-induced transport modulation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21790</link><description>arXiv:2512.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunable Magnetic and Topological Phases in EuMnXBi$_2$ (X=Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) Pnictides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21978</link><description>arXiv:2512.21978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of the layered pnictides EuMnXBi2 (X = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn), focusing in particular on the relatively unexplored Bi-based member of the EuMn2X2 family. Unlike the well-studied As-, Sb-, and P--based analogues, we show that EuMn2Bi2 stabilizes in a C-type antiferromagnetic ground state with a narrow-gap semiconducting character. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) drives a transition from this trivial antiferromagnetic semiconductor to a Weyl semimetal hosting four symmetry-related Weyl points and robust Fermi arc states. Systematic substitution of Mn with Fe, Co, and Zn further reveals a tunable sequence of magnetic ground states: Fe and Co induce ferrimagnetism with semimetallic behavior, while Zn stabilizes a ferromagnetic semimetal with a large net moment. These findings establish Bi-based EuMnXBi2 pnictides as a versatile platform where magnetic exchange interactions and band topology can be engineered through SOC and chemical substitution. The complex interplay of magnetic interactions and topological effects in the proposed bulk and doped pnictides opens a promising avenue to explore a wide range of electronic and magnetic phenomena. In particular, this study demonstrates that EuMn2Bi2 hosts tunable magnetic and topological phases driven by electron correlations, chemical substitution, and spin-orbit coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectricity in magnon Bose-Einstein condensate: non-reciprocal superfluidity, exceptional points and Majorana bosons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22073</link><description>arXiv:2512.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a ferroelectric instability of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensate, mediated by its interaction with an electric field through a geometric Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. A distinct feature of the system is the positive feedback loop in which an electric field induces magnon orbital motion via the AC phase, generating electric polarization that in turn enhances the original field. Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point. The corresponding eigenvector is an equally weighted superposition of bosonic quasiparticle and quasihole states and is invariant under particle-hole transformation, allowing it to be interpreted as a bosonic analog of a Majorana fermion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bose polarons as relativistic Unruh-DeWitt detectors: Entanglement harvesting from Bose-Einstein condensates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21381</link><description>arXiv:2512.21381v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: The notion of quantum symmetry has recently been extended to include reduced-dimensional transformations and algebraic structures beyond groups. Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21436v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21808</link><description>arXiv:2512.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21808v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Digital-Alloy Bragg Mirrors in High-Q Microcavities for Polariton Lasing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03203</link><description>arXiv:2512.03203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to the molecular-beam epitaxy of high-Q planar GaAs-based microcavities in which the AlGaAs high-index layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are replaced by short-period GaAs/AlAs superlattices (digital alloys) with similar optical properties. This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters.
  Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 570 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03203v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First principle study of electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) full Heusler: Application to embedded automotive systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07471</link><description>arXiv:2512.07471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, theoretical investigation on structural, electronic, magnetic, elastic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) alloys have been performed within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07471v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Shape descriptors of equilibrium states in a quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials: A geometric analysis near the phase transitions in Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12338</link><description>arXiv:2512.12338v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: This research work introduces the DFT through FP-LAPW+lo technique in WIEN2k software to obtain information about structural, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic characteristics of CaZnC and CaZnSi materials. The structural optimization was performed using PBE-GGA functional, while the rest of the characteristics were obtained with the PBE-GGA + TB-mBJ approach. The thermoelectric parameters were evaluated using BoltzTraP software. The elastic constants and other mechanical parameters were computed by utilizing the ELAST code within the WIEN2k software, while the thermodynamic characteristics were evaluated using the Gibbs2 program. The findings show a correlation between atomic composition and lattice dimensions while finding that CaZnC has a direct ($\Gamma$-$\Gamma$) band gap of $1.186$ eV, whereas CaZnSi has an indirect ($\Gamma$-$X$) band gap of $1.067$ eV. The optical studies of the compounds show potential applications for photovoltaics while the thermoelectric results find optimized power factors and figure of merit values for energy conversion performance. The elastic parameters of CaZnC and CaZnSi demonstrate material stability and brittleness. Lastly, the thermodynamic evaluations provide information about the thermal mechanism and disorder of the materials. As a result, this research work provides significant advancements in the understanding of the fundamentals of these compounds and highlights their promising applications in renewable energy technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15822v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Parameterized Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Approach to Simulate van der Waals Interactions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zz4xz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The strong coupling between light and matter inside optical cavities has emerged as a strategy to modify the chemical and physical properties of materials.

Here, we disclose the first cobalt-catalyzed intramolecular C−H silylation of arenes, enabled by the well-defined hydride complex HCo(PMe3)4. This catalyst sequentially activates Si−H and arene C–H bonds, enabling either an hydrosilylation/cyclization sequence or direct cyclization. The method features broad functional-group tolerance and delivers diverse heterosilacycles and silafluorenes in high yields and can be extended to germacycle. DFT studies support a two-electron mechanism involving oxidative addition of the Si–H bond, H2 elimination facilitated by a hydrogen acceptor, intramolecular C−H activation to form a cobaltacycle, and final reductive elimination to furnish the silacycle. Overall, this work establishes cobalt hydrides as a sustainable and effective alternative to noble metals for the synthesis of silacyclic architectures.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5h79?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

During the first cycle with the slowest compression, the observed orientations in the bcc and hcp phases are consistent with the Burgers mechanism, followed by &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis rotation of the hcp phase consistent with {10 1¯2} twinning. During the following cycles with fast compression at 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; GPa/s, the hcp phase exhibits negligible &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;-axis rotation with a nearly constant &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; ratio of ∼1.61 up to ∼30 GPa, indicating suppression of plastic deformation (especially, twinning) due to sample confinement from the gasket.

This suggests that defects or shear induced from the pressure cycling reduces the transition kinetics even during fast compression.

Notably, the device incorporating a IL with 2 ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles demonstrates strong performance, achieving a 2&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of 47.0 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.92 MV/cm. In contrast, for devices with ILs exceeding 8 ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles, the 2&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; value remains near 18 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; increases significantly. These divergent behaviors can be attributed to the different diffusion states of the insertion IL. For a low number of ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles, it is the diffusion of Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into the HZO region adjacent to the IL that results in a reduced &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, with higher ALD Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles, the IL forms a continuous layer that physically divides the 10 nm HZO film into two sections, which leads to a further decrease in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and an increase in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the progressive disruption of vertical grain boundaries by the growing insertion layer (IL) leads to a continuous decrease in leakage current.

Accordingly, the proposed Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/bilayer-FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; multiferroic device enables four distinct resistance states controlled by FE polarization and bias voltage, accompanied by 100% spin-polarized currents and a tremendous tunneling electroresistance ratio of 1.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;%. On this basis, fully electrically driven writing and reading of spin states coupled with multiple spin logic functions (NOR, AND, and XNOR) are observed. This work provides viable avenues for fusing storage and computing functions in a single multiferroic device.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/263501/3375661/Nonvolatile-spin-logic-in-memory-strategy-by-fully</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Single-crystal PMN-PT gated ferroelectric field-effect transistor for artificial visual application</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/264101/3375657/Single-crystal-PMN-PT-gated-ferroelectric-field</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a growing demand for neuromorphic devices that integrate high-speed performance with non-volatile storage. Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) have emerged as promising candidates, offering low power consumption, reliable non-destructive readout, and synaptic functionality. In this study, we present a high-performance FeFET incorporating 0.7Pb(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–0.3PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PMN-PT) as the dielectric layer and monolayer graphene as the channel material. The combination of PMN-PT's high dielectric constant and strong spontaneous polarization with graphene's exceptional conductivity and carrier mobility delivers superior electrical and optoelectronic properties. Experimental results demonstrate the device's capability to modulate channel conductance, achieve multi-level memory states, and exhibit synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation and depression under variable gate voltages and light intensities. Furthermore, the proposed FeFETs can be trained and recognize handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset with an excellent recognition accuracy of 94.8%. These findings highlight the potential of PMN-PT/graphene-based FeFETs for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, offering a pathway to next-generation AI hardware.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/264101/3375657/Single-crystal-PMN-PT-gated-ferroelectric-field</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Studies of Electronic Defects in Cs2NaInCl6 Double Perovskite by GFN1-xTB Calculations</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06450</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06450/asset/images/medium/jp5c06450_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry C&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06450&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:50:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c06450</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] GPU-Accelerated Analytic Coulomb- and Exchange Gradients for Hartree Fock and Density Functional Theory</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tt68b?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We present a GPU-accelerated software package for the evaluation of analytic two-electron energy and gradient contributions in Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density Functional theory (DFT) calculations. The implementation is provided as a Python library with a C++ backend, enabling straightforward integration into modern computational chemistry and drug-discovery workflows. The code supports single-point energy and nuclear gradient evaluations on both single- and multi-GPU systems, and employs MPI-based parallelization with dynamic load balancing in multi-node environments.  
We report comprehensive benchmarks demonstrating favorable scaling with respect to system size, as well as high throughput for batched evaluations relevant to molecular dynamics, geometry optimization, and large-scale virtual screening. Parallel execution of a single system was carried out on up to 24 A100 GPUs. The implementation builds on optimized GPU-enabled variants of the LibintX and GauXC libraries to efficiently compute density-fitted Coulomb, semi-numerical exchange, and exchange--correlation contributions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tt68b?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents] Simultaneous Nb5+‐Driven Defect Repair and Oxygen Stabilization of Spent LiNi0.88Co0.09Al0.03O2 Toward High‐Voltage and Fast‐Charging Cathode</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202505762?af=R</link><description>Advanced Energy Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Energy Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:30:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aenm.202505762</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today Physics] Machine learning aided bandgap and defect engineering of mixed halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529325003591?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 26 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Materials Today Physics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Ayush Kumar Pandey, Vivek Pandey, Abhishek Tewari&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Materials Today Physics</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 18:24:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529325003591</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Exploring the Polaron Landscape in Germanium Halide Perovskites: CsGeCl3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeI3</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c02516</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c02516/asset/images/medium/jz5c02516_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c02516&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:49:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c02516</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Defective TiOx Sublayers Break the Activity–Stability Trade-Off for Green Flexible Water Photoelectrolysis</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c12657</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c12657/asset/images/medium/nn5c12657_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c12657&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:37:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c12657</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Bioinspired Polypeptide Dendrimer‐Modified Thin‐Film Composite Membranes for Selective Lithium‐Magnesium Separation with DFT Insights</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202527985?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:14:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202527985</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Simulations of SiC crystal growth using molecular dynamics (MD) have become popular in recent years. They, however, simulate very fast deposition rates, to reduce computational costs. Therefore, they are more akin to surface sputtering, leading to abnormal growth effects, including thick amorphous layers and large defect densities. A recently developed method, called the minimum energy atomic deposition (MEAD), tries to overcome this problem by depositing the atoms directly at the minimum energy positions, increasing the time scale.
  We apply the MEAD method to simulate SiC crystal growth on stepped C-terminated 4H substrates with 4{\deg} and 8{\deg} off-cut angle. We explore relevant calculations settings, such as amount of equilibration steps between depositions and influence of simulation cell sizes and bench mark different interatomic potentials. The carefully calibrated methodology is able to replicate the stable step-flow growth, which was so far not possible using conventional MD simulations. Furthermore, the simulated crystals are evaluated in terms of their dislocations, surface roughness and atom mobility. Our methodology paves the way for future high fidelity investigations of surface phenomena in crystal growth.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link><description>arXiv:2512.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering experiments through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like statistics can also arise from a purely local, dynamical mechanism, which we elucidate using a minimal Lorenz-like model of a walking droplet. In this model, a localized defect perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This attractor-driven, local mechanism opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs based on active particles with internal degrees of freedom.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] From cluster to nanocrystal: the continuous evolution and critical size of copper clusters revealed by machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21067</link><description>arXiv:2512.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of cluster structure with size and the critical size for the transition from cluster to nanocrystal have long been fundamental problems in nanoscience. Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 &lt;= N &lt;= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N &lt; 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N &gt; 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 &lt;= N &lt;= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active Learning Guided Computational Discovery of 2D Materials with Large Spin Hall Conductivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21077</link><description>arXiv:2512.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices due to their tunable properties and potential for efficient spin-charge interconversion. However, discovering materials with intrinsically high spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is hindered by the vast chemical space and expensive nature of conventional experimental and first-principles methods. In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20785</link><description>arXiv:2512.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231</link><description>arXiv:2512.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13484</link><description>arXiv:2508.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work (Islam et al., 2025) showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. The simulations employ systems containing 2.4 million atoms and utilize a machine learning interatomic potential optimized to capture chemical complexity through the motif-based sampling technique. Using information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with processing parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13484v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Moir\'e spintronics: Emergent phenomena, material realization and machine learning accelerating discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04045</link><description>arXiv:2509.04045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena and engineering novel material properties in two dimensions, potentially revolutionizing developments in spintronics. This Review provides an overview of recent progress on emerging moir\'e spintronics in twisted vdW materials, with a particular focus on two-dimensional magnetic materials. Following a brief introduction to the general features of twisted vdW materials, we discuss recent theoretical and experimental studies on stacking-dependent interlayer magnetism, non-collinear spin textures, moir\'e magnetic exchange interactions, moir\'e skyrmions and moir\'e magnons. We further highlight the potential of machine learning to accelerate the discovery and design of multifunctional materials for moir\'e spintronics. Finally, we conclude by addressing the most pressing challenges and potential opportunities in this rapidly expanding field.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04045v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Inter-defect interactions, oxygen-vacancy distribution, and oxidation in acceptor-doped ABO3 perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20693</link><description>arXiv:2512.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of inter-defect interaction on the defect thermodynamics, local structure, and oxidation of acceptor-doped wide-gap ABO3 perovskites are explored using the developed statistical theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deciphering the lattice vibrational behaviors of CuInP2S6 by angle-resolved polarized Raman scattering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20925</link><description>arXiv:2512.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) exhibits unique cation hopping-driven phenomena that bring about unconventional properties with intriguing mechanisms and hold promises for advanced applications in nanoelectronics. However, an explicit analysis of its lattice dynamics and vibrational symmetries, pivotal for understanding the material's peculiar ferroelectric and ferroionic behaviors, remains incomplete. Here, we employ angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy in concert with first-principles calculations to systematically unravel the anisotropic lattice vibrations of CIPS single crystals. By analyzing the polarization-dependent Raman intensities, we determine the symmetry assignments and Raman tensors of all major vibrational modes, revealing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and non-invasive probe for structural and ferroelectric order evolution, by examining temperature-driven phase transitions and thickness-dependent polarization suppression in CIPS. Our findings establish a foundational framework for correlating lattice dynamics with functional properties in CIPS and provide a methodological blueprint for studying other vdW ferroelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Substrate Role in Polaron Formation on Single-layer Transition Metal Dihalides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21163</link><description>arXiv:2512.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer transition metal dihalides grown on conducting substrates were shown to host stable polarons. Here, we investigate polarons in insulating single-layer MnBr$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on three different substrates, namely graphene on Ir(110), graphene on Ir(111), and Au(111). The number densities and species of polarons observed vary strongly as a function of the substrate. For MnBr$_2$ grown on Ir(110) the largest number of polaron species is observed, namely four, of which three show clear similarities with the species observed for CoCl$_2$ on graphite. Polarons in single-layer MnBr$_2$ are observed up to 300K. They can be created, converted, and moved by the STM tip when a tunneling current flows at a proper bias voltage. For graphene on Ir(110) as a substrate, mobile polarons in MnBr$_2$ are guided through the periodic potential imposed from the super-moir\'e resulting from the interaction of MnBr$_2$ with graphene and Ir(110). Our findings indicate that modeling of polarons in such single-layer insulators in contact with a conducting substrate requires to take the substrate explicitly into account.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PhononBench:A Large-Scale Phonon-Based Benchmark for Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21227</link><description>arXiv:2512.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

Abstract: As we move beyond the era of transistor miniaturization, back-end-of-line-compatible transistors that can be stacked monolithically in the third dimension promise improved performance for low-power electronics. In advanced transistor architectures, such as gate-all-around nanosheets, the conventional channel-first process involves depositing dielectrics directly onto the channel. Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($&gt;$ 1 mA/$\mu$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic sampling of materials using neutral-atom quantum computers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21142</link><description>arXiv:2512.21142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $\alpha_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = \alpha_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $\Delta_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $\Delta\mu$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical arrest in active nematic turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15149</link><description>arXiv:2407.15149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluids display spontaneous turbulent-like flows known as active turbulence. Recent work revealed that these flows have universal features, independent of the material properties and of the presence of topological defects. However, the differences between defect-laden and defect-free active turbulence remain largely unexplored. Here, by means of large-scale numerical simulations, we show that defect-free active nematic turbulence can undergo dynamical arrest. This state is characterized by an emergent network of nematic domain walls that channels coherent streams and suppresses chaotic flows. As the system evolves, the branched wall network produces a large-scale pattern with tree-like topological properties. We find that flow alignment -- the tendency of nematics to reorient under shear -- enhances large-scale chaotic jets in contractile rodlike systems while promoting dynamical arrest in extensile systems. We further show that dynamical arrest persists regardless of whether defects are prohibited by construction or simply fail to form due to a high energy cost of defect cores. Taken together, our findings reveal a striking pattern-formation mechanism, with labyrinths emerging from active turbulence, and illuminate the rich transitional regime between defect-free and defect-laden dynamics. These behaviors call for the experimental realization of active nematics at vanishing or low defect densities, and underscore that, in extensile rodlike nematics, topological defects enable turbulence by preventing dynamical arrest.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.15149v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GEARS H: Accurate machine-learned Hamiltonians for next-generation device-scale modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10298</link><description>arXiv:2506.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10298v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07187</link><description>arXiv:2508.07187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07187v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Single-hole spectral functions in 1D quantum magnets with different ground states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20447</link><description>arXiv:2511.20447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,\omega)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,\tau)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,\omega)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.20447v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acoustoelectric Probing of Fractal Energy Spectra in Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06313</link><description>arXiv:2512.06313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\'e superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moir\'e-engineered 2D systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06313v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn) Heusler alloys as candidate materials for spintronic and microelectronic applications: Electronic structure, transport, and magnetism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20358</link><description>arXiv:2512.20358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $\Gamma$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20358v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Machine learning-assisted kinetic matching model for rational electrode design in aqueous zinc-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67996-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 25 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67996-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67996-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are safe and affordable but limited by incompatible electrode kinetics.

Abstract: Enhancing the kinetic stability of glasses often necessitates deepening thermodynamic stability, which typically compromises ductility due to increased structural rigidity. Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs. This work establishes a paradigm of kinetic stabilization without thermodynamic compromise, offering a roadmap to additively manufacture bulk amorphous materials with combined hyperstability and plasticity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Composition-Based Machine Learning for Screening Superconducting Ternary Hydrides from a Curated Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20228</link><description>arXiv:2512.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ensemble machine-learning approach for composition-based, structure-agnostic screening of candidate superconductors among ternary hydrides under high pressure. Hydrogen-rich hydrides are known to exhibit high superconducting transition temperatures, and ternary or multinary hydrides can stabilize superconducting phases at reduced pressures through chemical compression. To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of ensemble-based machine learning as a primary screening tool for identifying promising regions of chemical space in superconducting hydrides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Elemental Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20230</link><description>arXiv:2512.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Iterative learning scheme for crystal structure prediction with anharmonic lattice dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20424</link><description>arXiv:2512.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fundamentals of quantum Boltzmann machine learning with visible and hidden units</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19819</link><description>arXiv:2512.19819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19819v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link><description>arXiv:2506.10965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10965v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link><description>arXiv:2507.09001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic structure underpins advances in chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the development of powerful surrogate models that can enable the prediction of the ground state electron density and related properties at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional first principles simulations. Such ML models typically rely on massive datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculations. A key reason for relying on such large datasets is the lack of prior knowledge about which portions of the data are essential, and which are redundant. This study reveals significant redundancies in electronic structure datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and chemically complex alloys -- challenging the notion that extensive datasets are essential for accurate ML-based electronic structure predictions. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy that selects data across all learning difficulties, retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data, while reducing training time by threefold or greater. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate easy-to-learn data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors due to significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.09001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Domain Wall-mediated Interfacial Ferroelectric Switching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11997</link><description>arXiv:2508.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have demonstrated the importance of domain wall in polarization switching, the coexistence of various domain wall types and their impact on polarization stability lacks fundamental understanding. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls connect opposite polarization states and respond to out-of-plane electric field through polarization vector deviation, leading to inhomogeneous interlayer sliding and domain-wall migration. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, which are supported by our experimental observations. These insights shed light on the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, offering guidance for future nanoelectronics applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.11997v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06459</link><description>arXiv:2510.06459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06459v4</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: eScience] Achieving high-voltage polymer-based all-solid-state batteries based on thermodynamic and kinetic degradation insights</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725000631?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; eScience, Volume 6, Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Xiaoyan Yu, Yun Su, Hang Su, Ruizhi Liu, Jingyi Qiu, Xiayu Zhu, Rui Wen, Hao Zhang, Xiaohui Rong, Yong-Sheng Hu, Gaoping Cao&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: eScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:38:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725000631</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Chemical Reactivity Mapping: Exploring Chemical Reaction based on Digitalization of Small Molecules through Mayr’s Parameter</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1r6gz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>A new strategy for exploring novel reactions, utilizing Mayr’s reactivity parameters, is developed.

Recent discoveries of numerous second-generation ligands for Cu-mediated Ullmann-type cross-coupling reactions have broadened the scope to include less reactive aryl halides and nucleophiles and have also enabled lower copper and ligand loadings in these processes. However, in contrast to Pd chemistry, in-silico workflows for guiding systematic ligand selection from early-stage screening through optimization remain significantly less developed for Cu-catalyzed C-O and C-N bond coupling reactions. This report describes the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for streamlining ligand selection in Cu-catalyzed Ullmann-type coupling reactions. It provides a “map” of more than 80 ligands used in Ullmann couplings and is designed to reveal reactivity trends and highlight areas of high and low yields, thereby facilitating prioritization of high-value experiments in both medicinal and process chemistry settings. Validation for C-N and C-O couplings is provided using literature datasets, along with the development and application of a PCA-guided screening set for Ullmann couplings.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rqcts?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] High-throughput computational framework for high-order anharmonic thermal transport in cubic and tetragonal crystals</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01920-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 24 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01920-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-025-01920-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;High-throughput computational framework for high-order anharmonic thermal transport in cubic and tetragonal crystals</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01920-y</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Stepwise Zn(II) Coordination in a TPMA-Based Chiral Cage Probed by Circular Dichroism</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs6n6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The stepwise coordination of Zn(II) within a chiral cage featuring two intrinsic tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) binding sites was investigated using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) and TD-DFT calculations. NMR titrations reveal a sequential two-step metalation process, influenced by solvent polarity. The CD evolution mirrors this progression, showing well-defined isodichroic points and gradual blue-shift of the main bands. DFT optimizations indicate that Zn(II) coordination is accompanied by a progressive opening and rigidification of the TPMA arms, while TD-DFT simulations reproduce the observed redistribution of ECD intensities, consistent with changes in chromophore orientation and electronic coupling. These results define a relationship between metalation dynamics, structural reorganization and chiroptical response, illustrating how subtle structural changes at the coordination sites translate into measurable optical differences.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs6n6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Nature of Surface Sites in Ziegler-Natta Pre-Catalysts from Quanti-tative Analysis of Ti K-edge X-Ray Absorption Spectra</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2dv1x-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ziegler-Natta catalysts, discovered in 1950s, are still nowadays central to the industrial production of polyethylene and polypropylene. Despite being the workhorse of the polymer industry and despite years of extensive research, the improvement of Ziegler-Natta catalysts has been mostly empirical. In particular, the coordination surrounding of Ti sites in pre-catalysts, key for the formation of active sites upon AlEt3 activation, has been highly debated. Notably, quantification of different Ti sites on the MgCl2 surface has not been possible so far, hindering the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships. In this work, we prepared a series of pre-catalysts with increasing concentration of BCl3 modifier during the catalyst synthesis, known to affect the amount of Cl- and alkoxo-ligands in the Ti local surrounding as well as the activity in ethylene polymerization. We develop a methodology, relying on a library of theoretical XAS spectra for DFT-optimized structural models, benchmarked on a series of well-defined molecular compounds. Quantitative analysis of XAS data allows us to evaluate the relative fractions of Ti sites in fully Cl-surrounding as well as containing alkoxide and O-donor ligands. The analysis shows that the number of Ti-O bonds (initially mostly present in their alkoxo-form) decreases upon treatment with BCl3 up to B/Ti ratio of 2, coherent with earlier proposals, and increases afterwards, due to O-donor ligands, likely related to B-alkoxo species coordinated to Ti. The catalytic activity of these pre-catalysts after activation with AlEt3 in ethylene polymerization passes through a maximum at B/Ti ratio of ~2, pointing to its relation to the detrimental effect of O-based ligands on the activity. This approach allows to address and quantify the metal speciation in the complex Ziegler-Natta pre-catalysts and relate this to their catalytic activity, a first step towards establishing quantitative structure-activity relationships.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2dv1x-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Structure Revision of Isomallotusinin to Mallotusinin by NMR-Based Conformational Analysis</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xsgqb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>A reexamination of the reported structure of isomallotusinin, previously proposed as an anomer of the ellagitannin mallotusinin, demonstrates that this compound is identical to mallotusinin, thus correcting a structural misassignment.

Internal coordinates are constructed using xyzgraph, a flexible graph-based approach that achieves 98.4% agreement with DFT and 99.8% with existing methods across 4846 structures. Initial validation on 16 diverse TS achieved 100% identification of bond changes, rotations and inversions with zero false positives. Expansion to 395 diverse TS demonstrated robust performance, with 100.0% detection of the primary bond change and an overall agreement of 88.4% with Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) connectivity across 984 vibrational bonds. This approach enables programmatic TS verification and rapid reaction coordinate analysis in seconds, complementing more rigorous IRC and Quick Reaction Coordinate (QRC) methods while delivering robust, interpretable TS analysis across diverse chemical systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-k69gt-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Extra hole threshold in HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ferroelectric phase stabilization</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02438-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 24 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02438-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-025-02438-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stabilizing the ferroelectric phase in HfO2 is a critical challenge for its application in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a fundamental problem in materials science. We present CrystalFormer-CSP, an efficient framework that unifies data-driven heuristic and physics-driven optimization approaches to predict stable crystal structures for given chemical compositions. The approach combines pretrained generative models for space-group-informed structure generation and a universal machine learning force field for energy minimization. Reinforcement fine-tuning can be employed to further boost the accuracy of the framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrystalFormer-CSP on benchmark problems and showcase its usage via web interface and language model integration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin Reorientation Driven Renormalization of Spin-Phonon Coupling in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18544</link><description>arXiv:2512.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tackling dataset curation challenges towards reliable machine learning: a case study on thermoelectric materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18653</link><description>arXiv:2512.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) driven discovery of novel and efficient thermoelectric (TE) materials warrants experimental TE datasets of high volume, diversity, and quality. While the largest publicly available dataset, Starrydata2, has a high data volume, it contains inaccurate data due to the inherent limitations of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted data curation, ambiguous nomenclature and complex formulas of materials in the literature. Another unaddressed issue is the inclusion of multi-source experimental data, with high standard deviations and without synthesis information. Using half-Heusler (hH) materials as an example, this work is aimed at first highlighting these errors and inconsistencies which cannot be filtered with conventional dataset curation workflows. We then propose a statistical round-robin error-based data filtering method to address these issues, a method that can be applied to filter any other material property. Lastly, a hybrid dataset creation workflow, involving data from Starrydata2 and manual extraction, is proposed and the resulting dataset is analyzed and compared against Starrydata2.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological surface phonons modulate thermal transport in semiconductor thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18757</link><description>arXiv:2512.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While phonon topology in crystalline solids has been extensively studied, its influence on thermal transport-especially in nanostructures-remains elusive. Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18757v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link><description>arXiv:2512.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Long-range electrostatics for machine learning interatomic potentials is easier than we thought</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18029</link><description>arXiv:2512.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of long-range electrostatics is a key limitation of modern machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), hindering reliable applications to interfaces, charge-transfer reactions, polar and ionic materials, and biomolecules. In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microstructure-based Variational Neural Networks for Robust Uncertainty Quantification in Materials Digital Twins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18104</link><description>arXiv:2512.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aleatoric uncertainties - irremovable variability in microstructure morphology, constituent behavior, and processing conditions - pose a major challenge to developing uncertainty-robust digital twins. We introduce the Variational Deep Material Network (VDMN), a physics-informed surrogate model that enables efficient and probabilistic forward and inverse predictions of material behavior. The VDMN captures microstructure-induced variability by embedding variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture. Using an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation, the VDMN efficiently propagates uncertainty through the network during training and prediction. We demonstrate its capabilities in two digital-twin-driven applications: (1) as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, it predicts and experimentally validates the nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites; and (2) as an inverse calibration engine, it disentangles and quantitatively identifies overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties. Together, these results establish the VDMN as a foundation for uncertainty-robust materials digital twins.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lattice-Renormalized Tunneling Models for Superconducting Qubit Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18156</link><description>arXiv:2512.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice-renormalized formalism for configurational tunneling two-level systems (TLS) that overcomes limitations of minimum-energy-path and light-particle models. Derived from the nuclear Hamiltonian, our formulation introduces composite phonon coordinates to capture lattice distortions between degenerate potential wells. This approach resolves deficiencies in prior models and enables accurate computation of tunnel splittings and excitation spectra for hydrogen-based TLS in bcc Nb. Our results bound experimental tunnel splittings and reveal strong anharmonic couplings between tunneling atoms and lattice phonons, establishing a direct link between TLS dynamics and phonon-mediated strain interactions. The formalism further generalizes to multi-level systems (MLS), providing insight into defect-induced decoherence in superconducting qubits and guiding strategies for materials design to suppress TLS-related loss.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Agentic Framework for Autonomous Materials Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19458</link><description>arXiv:2512.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating scientific discovery, yet their static knowledge and hallucination issues hinder autonomous research applications. Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations. By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness. This work establishes a verifiable foundation for autonomous computational experimentation and represents a key step toward fully automated scientific discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Understanding the Lithium Ion Transport in Concentrated Block-Copolymer Electrolytes on a Microscopic Level</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11673</link><description>arXiv:2010.11673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block-copolymer electrolytes with lamellar microstructure show promising results regarding the ion transport in experiments. Motivated by these observations we study block-copolymers consisting of a polystyrene (PS) block and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block which were assembled in a lamellar structure. The lamella was doped with various amounts of lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) until very high loadings with ratios of EO monomers to cations up to 1:1 were reached. We present insights into the structure and ion transport from extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. For high salt concentrations most cations are not coordinated by PEO but rather by TFSI and THF. More specifically, LiTFSI partially separates from the PEO domain and forms a network-like structure in the middle of the lamella. This central salt-rich layer plays a decisive role to enable remarkably good cationic mobilities as well as high transport numbers in agreement with the experimental results.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2010.11673v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of multiple flat bands and van Hove singularities in the distorted kagome metal NdTi3Bi4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11488</link><description>arXiv:2311.11488v2 Announce Type: replace

Our investigation employs a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover the presence of two flat bands which are found to originate from the kagome structure formed by Ti atoms with major contribution from Ti dxy and Ti dx2-y2 orbitals. We also observed multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the Fermi level. The ARPES data reveals the existence of Dirac cone at the K point, a finding which is corroborated by our DFT calculations. These findings present detailed electronic structure capable of hosting correlation-driven phenomenon in this novel ferromagnetic kagome metal.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.11488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep Variational Free Energy Calculation of Hydrogen Hugoniot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18540</link><description>arXiv:2507.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model for the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow model for the unitary backflow transformation of electron coordinates in Hartree-Fock states. By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen for the temperature range where electrons occupy excited states. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. Our results bridge the gap between the results obtained by path-integral Monte Carlo calculations at high temperature and ground-state electronic methods at low temperature, thus providing a valuable benchmark for hydrogen in the warm dense matter region.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18540v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114</link><description>arXiv:2509.05114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.05114v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep learning directed synthesis of fluid ferroelectric materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16671</link><description>arXiv:2512.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16671v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anti-Correlated Noise in Epoch-Based Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implications for Weight Variances in Flat Directions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05300</link><description>arXiv:2306.05300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization due to its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.05300v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unified Micromechanics Theory of Composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14529</link><description>arXiv:2503.14529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14529v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Separating water content from network dynamics in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17362</link><description>arXiv:2504.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing forces, deformations and generally speaking the mechanical properties of cells is the hallmark of mechanobiology. In the last two decades many techniques have been developed to this end that are largely based on deforming the cells and measuring the reaction force. In cells, an alternative approach has been implemented mid 2010's, based on Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) that produces a spectrum that can be interpreted as the response of the sample to an infinitesimal uniaxial compression at picosecond timescales. In all of these measurements, the response of the cell is quantified with a colloquial "stiffness" that encompasses both the contribution of load-bearing structures and volume changes, much to confusion. To clarify the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that BLS shift alone is mostly sensitive to water content while the additional analysis of the linewidth allows identifying the contribution of the biopolymer-based network dynamics in living cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17362v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] BOOM: Benchmarking Out-Of-distribution Molecular Property Predictions of Machine Learning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01912</link><description>arXiv:2505.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven molecular discovery leverages artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and generative modeling to filter and design novel molecules. Discovering novel molecules requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, but ML models struggle to generalize OOD. Currently, no systematic benchmarks exist for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present $\mathbf{BOOM}$, $\mathbf{b}$enchmarks for $\mathbf{o}$ut-$\mathbf{o}$f-distribution $\mathbf{m}$olecular property predictions: a chemically-informed benchmark for OOD performance on common molecular property prediction tasks. We evaluate over 150 model-task combinations to benchmark deep learning models on OOD performance. Overall, we find that no existing model achieves strong generalization across all tasks: even the top-performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x higher than in-distribution. Current chemical foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation, while models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. We perform extensive ablation experiments, highlighting how data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation impact OOD performance. Developing models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors. Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.07150v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonreciprocal yet Symmetric Multi-Species Active Matter: Emergence of Chirality and Species Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18749</link><description>arXiv:2512.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal active matter systems typically feature an asymmetric role among interacting agents, such as a pursuer-evader relationship. We propose a multi-species nonreciprocal active matter model that is invariant under permutations of the particle species. The nonreciprocal, yet symmetric, interactions emerge from a constant phase shift in the velocity alignment interactions, rather than from an asymmetric coupling matrix. This system possessing permutation symmetry displays rich collective behaviors, including a species-mixed chiral phase with quasi-long-range polar order and a species separation phase characterized by vortex cells. The system also displays a coexistence phase of the chiral and the species separation phases, in which intriguing dynamic patterns emerge. These rich collective behaviors are a consequence of the interplay between nonreciprocity and permutation symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside through fluoride doping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19014</link><description>arXiv:2512.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the divide: Economic exchange and segregation in dual-income cities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18680</link><description>arXiv:2512.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segregation is a growing concern around the world. One of its main manifestations is the creation of ghettos, whose inhabitants have difficult access to well-paid jobs, which are often located far from their homes. In order to study this phenomenon, we propose an extension of Schelling's model of segregation to take into account the existence of economic exchanges. To approximate a geographical model of the city, we consider a small-world network with a defined real estate market. The evolution of the system has also been studied, finding that economic exchanges follow exponential laws and relocations are approximated by power laws. In addition to this, we consider the existence of delays in the actions of the agents, which mainly affect the happiness of those with fewer economic resources. Besides, the size of the economic exchange plays a crucial role in overall segregation. Despite its simplicity, we find that our model reproduces real-world situations such as the separation between favoured and handicapped economic areas, the importance of economic contacts between them to improve the distribution of wealth, and the existence of efficient and cheap transport to break the poverty cycles typical of disadvantaged zones.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Information Supercurrents in Chiral Active Matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link><description>arXiv:2512.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative (phase rigidity) information supercurrents, analogous to a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically and empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16884v2</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Materials] In situ polymerization for high performance solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01035-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Materials, Published online: 23 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01035-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s43246-025-01035-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries promise high energy density, long-term performance, and enhanced safety, but face challenges with interfacial issues due to poor solid–solid contact.

This perspective argues that time-dependent structural change is a crucial, but often overlooked, mechanistic feature as many reactions simply do not follow a single, equilibrated minimum-energy path. We highlight examples where traditional transition state theory fails, typically cases involving short-lived interme-diates, non-equilibrium solvation, momentum-controlled selectivity, post-transition state bifurcations, and “hidden” dy-namic intermediates and show how molecular dynamics can reveal the actual sequence of structural change which gov-erns a reaction outcome. We also discuss emerging machine learning-based molecular dynamics which have found appli-cations in photochemistry and solvent modelling. While molecular dynamics will not replace methods based on transi-tion state theory, it offers organic chemists a time-resolved view of molecular structure which can be crucial to under-standing a given reaction. However, a central barrier for organic chemists is to understand when and why to apply an ad-vanced computational technique such as molecular dynamics simulations. In this perspective, we aim to introduce the methodology in sufficient detail to enable organic chemists to make this assessment and gain an appreciation for the im-portance of time in reaction mechanisms.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fclzt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Characterisation and immobilisation study of the Haloperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis: application to phenol derivatives</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jcmpt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In the past decades, usage of enzymes to catalyse halogenation reactions has emerged as a greener approach compared to usual ones using toxic reagents and yielding to a bad atom economy. Vanadium dependent haloperoxidases (VDHals) are the most commonly used enzymes for such transformations in organic chemistry due to their robustness. Among them, haloperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) is the most cited in the literature but only barely characterized aside from its substrate spectrum and kinetic parameters. In the present study, we evaluated the melting temperature, thermostability, thermoactivity and solvent stability of CiVCPO in order to have a better overview of its potential in organic synthesis. We have also performed the first immobilisation study of this enzyme on 3 types of supports: 3 EziG™ glass beads coated with different polymers, 5 Relizyme™ polymethacrylate beads with different functional groups, the commercial Amberlite IRA900 and Dowex 50WX8, and 3 metal-organic frameworks from the UiO-66(Zr) family. As a result, we could retain 50% of total immobilized activity on 2 Relizyme supports (ethylamine (EA403) &amp; iminodiacetic (IDA403), with 55% activity kept over 5 recycling steps. The unconventional UiO-66(Zr) family also proved to be an interesting material for this enzyme. Finally, we show that free enzyme and supported enzyme are suitable for bromination and chlorination of a range of phenolic compounds with excellent yields with up to 65% conversion in 24 h in the tested conditions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jcmpt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Nanotechnology] Nanostructured niobium-doped nickel-rich multiphase positive electrode active material for high-power lithium-based batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Nanotechnology, Published online: 23 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41565-025-02092-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A two-step doping strategy for preparing Nb-doped Ni-rich positive electrode active materials forms nanosized grains and enables reversible multiphase transitions, improving lithium-ion transport and high-power performance of Li-based batteries.</description><author>Nature Nanotechnology</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Study of anion transport by amide-based macrocycles of different sizes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g4gds?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Synthetic anion receptors can transport anions across lipid bilayer membranes. Many anion transporters have been reported, including macrocyclic compounds. However, there are no systematic studies on how the size of macrocycles impacts their anion transport activity and selectivity. Therefore, we prepared eight amide-based macrocyclic compounds with ring sizes ranging from 18 to 26 atoms, as well as four bis-amides. We studied these compounds as anion receptors using chloride titrations and molecular modelling, and as anion transporters using liposomes with various fluorescent probes. Neither the size of the macrocycles nor the affinity for chloride were found to be determining factors for chloride transport activity; preorganisation appears to play a more important role. Fluorination was found to have a clear positive effect on anion transport rates, with the bis-amides performing surprisingly well compared to the macrocycles. The smallest non-fluorinated macrocycle exhibited selectivity for chloride over hydroxide and nitrate, whereas the pentafluorophenyl bis-amide demonstrated effective transport of bicarbonate and nitrate, likely due to anion-pi interactions in addition to hydrogen bonding. The insights from this study will shape the design of future anionophores.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g4gds?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ion-Conductive Vitrimers Based on Backbone-Type Triazolium Poly(ionic liquid)s: Counterion-Dependent Dynamics and Backbone Flexibility</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2mmg1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>To simultaneously achieve high ionic conductivity and recyclability, vitrimers were prepared using backbone-type triazolium poly(ionic liquid)s (TPILs) that integrate ionic transport with dynamic network rearrangement via trans-N-alkylation. TPIL elastomers bearing I⁻, BF₄⁻, PF₆⁻, and TFSI⁻ counteranions were synthesized from “clickable” ionic liquid monomers, and their glass transition temperature (Tg), ionic conductivity, and vitrimeric dynamics were compared. Only the I⁻-based network exhibited stress relaxation at 170 °C, indicating that nucleophilic anions are important for bond exchange. However, a trade-off was observed between ionic transport and dynamic network rearrangement. Furthermore, mixed-anion TPIL elastomers using I⁻+TFSI⁻ exhibited lower Tg and higher ionic conductivity than I⁻-based elastomer, while still maintaining vitrimer-like relaxation. The segmental relaxation was decoupled from Arrhenius-type bond-exchange dynamics. Ionic conduction was dominated by segmental motion, with minimal contribution from cross-link exchange. This design combining flexible polymer backbones and cooperative anion engineering can create recyclable, highly conductive polymer electrolytes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2mmg1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Advances in Calcium Isotope Purification and Analysis Using Cutting-Edge Signal Amplifiers for Matrix-Diverse Reference Materials</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ddk2z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Stable calcium (Ca) isotopes are increasingly applied across geosciences, medical sciences, ecology, paleontology, and archaeology. However, the deployment speed of Ca isotope applications worldwide is hampered by three major challenges: 1) the necessity for complex Ca purification procedures prior to analysis; 2) expensive instrumentation (typically TIMS or ICP-MS) requiring specific configurations and fine-tuning to generate reliable data; and 3) the exhaustion of some of the most widely used reference materials for cross-laboratory comparisons. In this study we present methodological advances aimed at lifting some of these barriers. First, we refined existing chromatography methods for purifying Ca by developing a branching procedure based on commercially available labware to allow faster method transfer and to minimize resin and reagent consumption for a variety of sample matrices. Our adjustments drastically improved strontium (Sr) separation from Ca, including for Sr-rich samples such as seawater. Second, we explored the potential of 10¹³Ω Faraday cup amplifiers for improving Ca isotope measurements. Our results show improved precision in 43Ca measurements under low ionic transmission configurations with δ43/42Ca standard deviation value reduced by half. This expands the list of ICP-MS configurations capable of producing reliable Ca isotope measurements and delineates a path for less sample-destructive methods (i.e., lower Ca analytical requirements). These amplifiers also markedly enhanced the correction of Sr²⁺ interferences typically affecting Ca ion beams. In this configuration, accurate and precise Ca isotopic measurements were obtained without prior Sr removal for Sr/Ca concentration ratios up to 10⁻². Lastly, using these technical advancements we analyzed existing and new international certified reference materials (SRM1486, SRM1400, IAPSO, CACB-1, DOLT-5, DORM-5, TORT-3), complementing existing and out-of-stock standards of the Ca isotope toolbox, notably for Ca carbonate and marine soft tissues. Together, these advances open the door of Ca isotope research to more laboratories and pave the way for future developments and applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ddk2z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Predicting Sequence Dependent Fluorescence with Classic Machine Learning Models</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs62c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Terminally labeled DNA oligonucleotides have wide applications in modern biology and biotechnological applications. It has been observed that the fluorescent intensity of light released from these fluorescent labels is heavily influenced by the terminal sequence of nucleotides. Recent studies have assayed and published the raw fluorescent values of  Cy3 and Cy5 as a function of the most adjacent 5 nucleotides resulting in 1024 data points. While experimentally tractable, an increase in the sequence space will vastly increase the experimental and time cost. Machine Learning is well suited to addressing the issue of experimental tractability however there is a wide design space in the choice of algorithms. In this work we use classic machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptrons and Random Forests to both predict the raw intensity value and classify the intensity magnitude of the fluorophore using the sequence as input. We demonstrate that the performance of these models is heavily dependent on the numerical transformation of the sequence and that Random Forest consistently outperforms all other models in both regression and classification tasks irrespective of the sequence transformation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs62c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine learning driven advances in molecular dynamics of bulk and interfacial aqueous systems</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6vdl2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely applied to investigate various physical and chemical processes in aqueous and interfacial environments, which are crucial for the design of energy materials and for understanding several chemical processes at the heart of life itself. However, the applicability of MD simulations has been constrained by several inherent challenges, including the accuracy of force fields, limitations in simulation size and timescales. One promising solution to these challenges is the integration of machine learning (ML) methods, both for improved description of the nature of interactions in aqueous systems as well as for enhanced sampling. In this review, we discuss the principles, implementation, and applications of ML force fields (MLFFs) and ML enhanced sampling methods to the study of aqueous, interfacial systems. We discuss five key categories of applications that use MLFFs, ML-enhanced sampling, and ML-driven data analytics. We first discuss how MLFFs are enabling quantum level accuracy at classical level cost for large scale simulations of complex aqueous and interfacial systems, and then highlight how coupling them with enhanced sampling and advanced data analytics, especially graph based approaches for featurizing such systems, can be used both for enhancing simulations and for understanding them by yielding reliable low dimensional reaction coordinates that improve the interpretation of high dimensional MD data. The discussed applications include investigations into the structure and dynamics of bulk water and aqueous interfaces, proton transfer, catalysis, phase transitions, and the prediction of vibrational spectra. In each case, we highlight how ML-based methods enable simulations that were previously computationally prohibitive and provide new physical insights into aqueous solutions and interfaces. For instance, MLFFs allow nanosecond-scale simulations with thousands of atoms while maintaining quantum chemistry accuracy. Additionally, ML-enhanced sampling facilitates the crossing of large reaction barriers and enables the exploration of extensive configuration spaces. Moreover, ML models trained on simulation data uncover previously overlooked factors, such as the role of solvent dynamics in phase transitions. The combination of MLFFs with enhanced sampling techniques makes the calculation of high-dimensional free energy surfaces feasible, significantly improving our understanding of chemical reactions. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in this field and outline potential future research directions to further advance the integration of ML in MD simulations.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6vdl2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

We systematically investi- gate data selection strategies to optimize the Chebyshev Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES) po- tential for the Bi-Pt nanoclusters by comparing three innovative sampling methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)/k-means (structural diversity), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)/k-means (force-space di- versity), and hierarchical clustering. Quantitatively, the PCA/k-means strategy proved most effective for global ac- curacy, yielding the lowest force errors and achieving energy root mean square errors (RMSE) values competitive with DFT, demonstrating excellent accuracy (19.16 meV/atom). Structural validation on 34 unique DFT-optimized isomers further confirmed the potential’s high fidelity, with the best model PCA/k-means reproducing structures with an average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.10 Å. However, the t-SNE methods, by maximizing diversity in the force space, demonstrated superior extrapolative power, leading to the more precise prediction of a novel stel- lated octadecagon Bi18Pt24 cage structure, demonstrating the potential for exploring previously unseen morphologies. Our results establish a clear methodology for strategic data sampling that successfully maximizes ML-IAP transfer- ability, providing an accurate and computationally efficient tool that accelerates the theoretical discovery of complex bimetallic architectures.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g77x9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] High-Performance Semiempirical Excited-State Molecular Dynamics: A Step Toward Data-Driven Photodynamics</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6h565?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We introduce excited-state molecular dynamics (ESMD) in PYSEQM, a GPU-accelerated semiempirical quantum chemistry engine implemented in PyTorch. The new module enables Born-Oppenheimer (single-surface) dynamics using configuration-interaction singles and random phase approximation for excited-states, allowing long trajectories and large statistical ensembles to be simulated efficiently on a single GPU. We also implement an extended-Lagrangian ESMD (XL-ESMD) scheme that propagates auxiliary electronic variables, enabling relaxed ground and excited-state convergence thresholds without compromising energy conservation. The ESMD implementation scales smoothly from small chromophores to a nearly 900-atom dendrimer (taking 6.5 s per ESMD step). PYSEQM also supports batched execution, allowing many geometries or trajectories to be evaluated in a single GPU launch, substantially increasing throughput and making ensemble-based protocols routine. As a demonstration, we compute absorption, emission, and infrared spectra from trajectories propagated on the ground and first excited states, illustrating practical utility of PYSEQM. The XL-ESMD scheme yields identical spectra at significantly lower computational cost, establishing the role of extended Lagrangian based dynamics for efficient ESMD simulations. Beyond raw performance, PYSEQM’s Pytorch foundation provides  automatic differentiation for forces, efficient GPU batching, and seamless interfacing with machine learning models. These capabilities position PYSEQM as practical platform for machine learning-augmented excited-state dynamics and lay the foundation for future data-driven nonadiabatic ESMD modeling of ultrafast spectroscopic probes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6h565?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Mixed ionic–electronic conductor based on B 16  framework</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251904/3375535/Mixed-ionic-electronic-conductor-based-on-B16</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) are essential materials for next-generation energy storage and conversion systems. However, several limitations—including the scarcity of intrinsic MIEC materials, low ionic conductivity, and a narrow operational temperature range—restrict their practical use. Based on the experimentally synthesized MgB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal, this study designs a B&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; covalent framework with three-dimensionally connected channels by theoretically removing Mg atoms through computational methods. Using first-principles calculations and machine learning molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically explore its compounds' potential as intrinsic MIEC materials. The results indicate that the B&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; framework can stably host and transport Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with different valences.

However, the high intrinsic carrier concentration of the InGaAs NW and the ionization scattering caused by surface defect states result in a high dark current, which degrades the photodetection performance. Here, we prepared an InGaAs NW field-effect transistor modulated by ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE), where the non-volatile ultra-high electrostatic field from polarization of the P(VDF-TrFE) film modulates the carrier distribution and energy band structure inside the NW. When the P(VDF-TrFE) film is in a negative polarization state, the electrostatic field depletes the carriers in the NW channel, remarkably suppressing the dark current by over two orders of magnitude. Consequently, our single InGaAs NW photodetector achieves both remarkable responsivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;) of 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and specific detectivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;D*&lt;/span&gt;) of 7.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at the optical communication wavelength, significantly exceeding the commercial InGaAs and the nanowire-based photodetector. Moreover, the suppressed dark current enhances the polarization-sensitive detection capability, increasing the polarization ratio from 1.3 to 3.6.

A key limitation to its practical application is its moderate polarization strength. This study reports the polarization evolution of CIPS across a wide range of temperatures and pressures and elucidates the mechanisms underlying polarization enhancement under various conditions. The polarization enhancement observed under high-pressure-high-temperature conditions is attributed to the increased occupancy of Cu ions at out-of-plane (Cu&lt;sup&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt;) sites, which correspond to high-polarization configurations. In contrast, the high-pressure-low-temperature polarization improvement stems from enhanced ordering of Cu ions. Furthermore, a phase diagram of CIPS over a wide range of temperatures and pressures was established based on Raman spectroscopy and ferroelectric polarization measurements. This diagram further illustrates dipole ordering and Cu-ion freezing in the low-temperature &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Cc&lt;/span&gt; phase. This work provides valuable insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic manipulation of ferroelectric polarization via stress engineering, offering both foundational principles and a deeper understanding of two-dimensional van der Waals ferroelectrics and their potential applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041425/3375561/Phase-diagram-of-CuInP2S6-across-wide-temperature</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Structure--Dynamics--Property Relationship Reveals the Origin of Porous Integrity in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1kkhm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Flexibility encoded in low-frequency lattice dynamics has been shown to be effective at understanding various properties of porous materials, especially metal--organic frameworks, but remains largely unexplored in structurally similar covalent organic frameworks~(COFs). Here, we establish a structure--dynamics--property relationship for two COFs by combining three-dimensional electron diffraction, low-frequency vibrational spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Using 3D electron diffraction, we determine, for the first time, the crystal structure of the closed-pore reduced framework COF-300-AR, revealing a bent linker conformation. Terahertz and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, together with solid-state DFT and local mode analysis, are then used to resolve the low-frequency lattice dynamics of COF-300 and closed-pore COF-300-AR and to quantify linker flexibility in terms of imine/amine torsions. Normal mode decomposition and torsional potential energy surfaces show that these torsions are roughly twice as stiff in \h\ as in \AR, and that the reduced framework has a shallower, multi-well torsional potential energy landscape, which permits the observed closed-pore structure. In \h, the same torsional coordinate is much stiffer, locking the structure into a porous framework. More broadly, this work demonstrates how combining advanced structure determination with low-frequency vibrational spectroscopy and first-principles calculations can identify, and subsequently tune, the coordinates that control pore opening, guest uptake, and structural integrity in flexible COFs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1kkhm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] An Interpretative Charge-Transfer Framework for Molecules Adsorbed on Graphene Inspired by the van Arkel–Ketelaar Diagram</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7wx80?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>An interpretive graphical framework is presented for rationalizing charge-transfer phenomena at molecule–graphene interfaces. Inspired by the classical van Arkel–Ketelaar diagram, the model unifies n- and p-doping pathways within a single representation by explicitly distinguishing between integer charge transfer (ICT) and partial charge transfer (PCT). By mapping the mean frontier-orbital energy and the molecular energy gap onto a triangular coordinate space, the framework provides a compact visualization of the energetic conditions that govern charge transfer, conditions typically dispersed across multiple band–orbital diagrams constructed separately for each adsorbate–adsorbent pair. This single-diagram approach enables the qualitative interpretation of a virtually limitless number of energetic scenarios, initially considering ideal physicochemical conditions. It is further shown that the graphical topology is preserved under non-ideal interface effects, including vacuum-level offsets, interfacial dipoles, structural defects, and finite temperature, which highlights the robustness and broad applicability of the model. Beyond its conceptual value, the framework fulfills a didactic role by offering an intuitive tool for teaching and learning topics related to solid-state chemistry, surface chemistry, interfacial phenomena, doping mechanisms, adsorption, and interfacial charge transfer.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

However, most techniques measure quantities dependent on multiple biophysical properties rather than individual ones, limiting their biological/clinical relevance. Here, we present a single-cell biophysical phenotyping technique that quantifies size (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dc&lt;/span&gt;) and elastic modulus (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;) of cells deforming at different levels along constriction microchannels.

Parallel-channel device design achieves a reasonably high throughput of ∼10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells/min. The measurement employs lock-in amplification-assisted electrokinetic sensing via embedded electrodes across three channel sections with varying constriction widths, inducing distinct cell deformations. We demonstrate the technique by profiling normal and cancerous breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231), as well as drug-treated cancer cells (cytochalasin D, cetuximab, and lysophosphatidic acid). The biophysical phenotyping enables cell classification with high accuracy (&amp;gt;95.45% via principal component analysis; &amp;gt;97.32% via machine learning). This approach offers robust and high-throughput cell classification, with potential applications in basic research and clinical diagnostics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Open Issues</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/253702/3375461/High-throughput-sensing-of-single-cell-properties</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Open Issues] Coherent phonon tunneling-driven ultralow and non-monotonic thermal conductivity in quasi-0D Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252201/3375357/Coherent-phonon-tunneling-driven-ultralow-and-non</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Low-dimensional copper halides have emerged as promising thermoelectric materials due to their phonon-glass electron-crystal behavior, yet their thermal transport mechanisms remain insufficiently understood.

Intriguingly, the competing contributions of coherent and incoherent terms induce an anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;κ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; along the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; axis, with an initial decrease followed by an unexpected rise.

However, a significant barrier to their development is the lack of a comprehensive materials database, which hinders systematic studies and the discovery of emergent AOS materials. This study addresses this gap by constructing a dedicated database of zinc-tin-based doped oxide semiconductors (Zn–M–Sn–O) and their thin-film transistor (TFT) performance parameters, compiled from an extensive review of existing literature. Our research aims to perform a systematic analysis of the correlations between key material properties and device performance. We summarize and analyze existing Zn–M–Sn–O based optoelectronic devices, extracting key features such as material compositions, processing parameters, and performance metrics. These features are then used to construct feature vectors. By applying a machine learning algorithm to this dataset, we establish a performance prediction model for Zn–M–Sn–O TFTs. This machine learning-assisted approach allows us to efficiently screen materials and predict the optimal M element for high-performance devices.

However, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ( κ) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs), including recently developed foundation models. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and HIPHIVE against density functional theory and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on  κ. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Missense mutations in cancer: in silico predictions, developing treatments, and overcoming cell resistance.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6928d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Targeted therapies built around specific genetic driver mutations have become a cornerstone of precision oncology.

Computations combined with experiments have gained increasing attention for electrolyte development. However, the inherent complexity of electrolytes poses a significant challenge. Classical molecular dynamics often fails due to inaccuracies in force field parameters, while ab initio calculationsarelimitedbyhighcomputationalcosts. Recently, machinelearning molecular dynamics has emerged as an efficient and accurate alternative. However, its application is hindered by limited transferability of machine learning potentials. In this work, we developed a universal machine learning potential for electrolytes using an iterative training approach on randomly composed datasets, enabling the accurate computation of key properties for a broad range of electrolytes via molecular dynamics. Furthermore, coordination dynamics analysis of Li ion, by quantifying the coordination lifetime, provides a direct, quantitative measure of solvation strength. The universal machine learning potential for electrolytes facilitates the prediction and optimization of electrolyte properties, offering a powerful tool for electrolyte design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fnw1w-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Large-scale structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis enables functional annotation of animal venom peptides</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gd3c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Animal venoms constitute one of the most chemically diverse and pharmacologically rich peptide repertoires in nature, yet the vast majority of venom peptides remain structurally and functionally unannotated due to limited material availability and a paucity of experimentally solved structures. This knowledge gap has significantly constrained both mechanistic understanding and translational applications of venom-derived molecules. Here we conduct a comprehensive structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis of close to 4,000 venom peptides (i.e. teretoxins and conotoxins) from marine snails using AlphaFold2. While conotoxins have been studied for over six decades, teretoxins remain largely unexplored. Our study provides the first comprehensive structural classification and functional annotation of the entire known teretoxin repertoire, substantially expanding the venom peptide landscape. Structural clustering analysis revealed that both teretoxins and conotoxins form a large number of structural clusters (225 and 307 clusters, respectively), with each cluster characterized by conserved cysteine frameworks and disulfide connectivity. Importantly, combining structural clusters with phylogenetic analysis revealed that structure prediction together with cysteine frameworks offer an improved strategy for venom peptide classification. We used predicted disulfide connectivity from derived from AlphaFold2 models to annotate the majority of uncharacterized conotoxins on ConoServer database, addressing a long-standing classification bottleneck in venom peptide classification efforts. As a concrete demonstration of functional prediction, co-clustering of predicted teretoxin and conotoxin structures led to the identification of teretoxins structurally homologous to conotoxins with described activities, suggesting shared functional activities such as Kunitz-type peptide activity, neurotoxicity, and ion channel inhibition. Using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on our Kunitz-type peptide co-cluster, we observed that conotoxin P07849 and teretoxin Tar2.9 engage trypsin in a manner similar to the Kunitz Domain 1 (KD1) of the Alzheimer’s amyloid beta-protein precursor (APPI), a previously unappreciated protease inhibitory role for this venom peptide family. Overall, this work establishes a scalable, structure-centric framework that combines structure prediction, structural clustering, co-clustering, and phylogenetics for deorphanizing venom peptides, enabling predicted annotation and functional inference for future experimental, pharmacological, and therapeutic exploration.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gd3c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Performance of dispersion models in predicting ambient hydrocarbon concentrations at a regional air quality monitor in an oil and gas producing region</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xkhh9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The performance of four widely used dispersion models (AERMOD, a single equation Gaussian formulation, and two versions of CALPUFF) for predicting ambient hydrocarbon concentrations at a regional air quality monitor in the Eagle Ford Shale oil and gas production region was assessed. Model performance is found to vary considerably based on the performance objective, meteorological conditions, and temporal resolution. Among the models evaluated in this work, the methods used to estimate the dispersion coefficients and whether the model was plume- or puff-based strongly influenced model performance. Uncertainties in meteorological and emissions inputs also played an important role in model performance, but the significance of their impact varied depending on the performance objective.

The information content of the scope, as demonstrated by its performance and diversity, is crucial to inform the quality of this decision. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and easy to use machine learning algorithm, ScopeBO, for the selection of scopes that balance these two aspects. We use the Vendi score as a metric for scope diversity and establish a scope score that quantifies scope performance within the context of a specific chemical search space. The hyperparameters of ScopeBO are optimized using these metrics, and its performance is validated with several reaction datasets, demonstrating favorable performance against that of alternative selection methods. Through this quantitative optimization, ScopeBO provides an approach towards objective and standardized scope selection that maximizes the information content of the evaluated substrates.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r0sst?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Relationship Between Local Disorder and Atomic Motion in an Antiperovskite Solid Electrolyte</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dxdtz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Solid-state electrolytes are an alternative to conventional liquid systems for safer and more efficient batteries, whereas a shift from Li to Na would unlock systems with increased resource availability and simplified supply chains. Antiperovskite Na2[NH2][BH4] recently emerged as a candidate that showcases that internal polyanion dynamics can facilitate Na transport. However, experimental validation of the predicted mechanisms of atomic motion remains scarce. To this end, we investigate the intricate relationship between local atomic disorder and dynamic motion. Maps of atomic disorder from total scattering data reproduce the predictions of polyanion rotation and Na translation by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The comparison also reveals the concurrence of BD4- translations, which were overlooked in previous analyses, and the existence of static disorder due to the different degrees of freedom of each anion, even while maintaining their ideal shape. This complex interplay refines mechanisms governing ion dynamics that determine solid-state electrolyte functionality. Realistic design strategies for rotor-based electrolytes must explicitly account for polyanion translation and static disorder, rather than optimizing rotational freedom in isolation. The combination of total scattering experiments with AIMD provides a route to screen potential polyanion-based candidates for favorable multi-modal disorder, thus steering the discovery of new phases with transformational ionic conductivity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dxdtz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Multi-Objective Catalyst Discovery in High-Entropy Alloy Composition Space: The Role of Noble Metals on the Pareto Front for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cq92m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Discovering new materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions is a key step toward energy sustainability. However, for catalysts to be viable in practice, they must perform in multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. We demonstrate this challenge for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where activity, stability, and material cost must be balanced. Using the continuous composition space of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) together with our established models for activity and dissolution, we identify a Pareto-optimal set of ORR catalysts within the Ag–Au–Cu–Ir–Pd–Pt–Rh–Ru system via multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we introduce a fine-tuned machine learning model that predicts adsorption energies for alloys spanning 12 elements and 9 adsorbates.  Our results show that alloying expands the hypervolume spanned by the Pareto front, consisting of low- to medium-entropy alloys composed primarily of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, and Pt. We further propose an approach for analyzing the Pareto front by quantifying the loss in hypervolume when critical elements (Au, Pd, and Pt) are removed, clarifying their relative contributions to optimal performance.  This work highlights the need to consider all relevant objectives in catalyst optimization and the advantage of HEAs as a powerful platform for multi-objective catalyst discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cq92m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Agent-based framework for modeling hyperlocal urban air quality</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-v1lhr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Urban air quality exhibits significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity at hyperlocal scales, necessitating advanced modeling paradigms that can bridge the gap between computationally intensive physics-based models and empirically-driven statistical approaches. This paper introduces a novel agent-based modeling framework specifically designed for hyperlocal air quality assessment, capable of providing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. The proposed framework discretizes urban environments into interacting agents, with pollutant dynamics governed by a parameterized mass balance that preserves fundamental physics while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is demonstrated through a case study in Chennai, India, using mobile monitoring data across a 25 km route with 250 m spatial resolution. Geospatial features (traffic, land use, meteorology) are encoded as agent properties through physically interpretable parameters. This enables transparent attribution of pollution sources and transport pathways, thereby strengthening the framework’s descriptive capabilities. The approach successfully captures complex spatio-temporal pollution dynamics and describes pollution hotspots by attributing them to source and transport influences. Predictive capabilities are demonstrated through spatio-temporal interpolation and temporal forecasting. Spatio-temporal formulation of the framework enables it to outperform regular unidimensional methods. The discrete agent structure facilitates prescriptive applications, demonstrated here through identification of least-exposure routes between locations. The unification of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive capabilities within a single interpretable framework makes it a potentially valuable tool for urban environmental management and real-time decision support systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-v1lhr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Widely Targeted Metabolomics and Machine Learning Identify Succinate as a Key Metabolite in Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02781-6?rss=yes</link><description>Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment.

Conventional skyrmion-based racetracks employ binary encoding through inter-skyrmion spacing in one-dimensional nanostrips, yet maintaining precise spacing remains challenging due to thermal fluctuations, noise, and material defects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-lane racetrack architecture separated by an engineered domain wall. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that this design offers several critical advantages: (1) Topological repulsion from the domain wall effectively confines skyrmions to their respective lanes, eliminating cross-lane migration. (2) The motion dynamics of skyrmions in one lane exhibit minimal interference from those in the adjacent lane, owing to the topological repulsion from the domain wall that ensures a sufficiently large inter-lane spacing to weaken dipole interactions. (3) The structure enables programmable operations, including skyrmion sorting, directional transport, and controlled annihilation.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252404/3375468/Domain-wall-isolated-dual-lane-racetrack-for</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Healing the buried interface with versatile glutamic acid for efficient and stable SnO 2 -based perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/253901/3375359/Healing-the-buried-interface-with-versatile</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Effectively suppressing defects at the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite (PVK) interface is critical for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we introduce glutamic acid (Glu) into SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving synergistic regulation of the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PVK interface properties. The introduction of Glu not only significantly suppresses SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; agglomeration but also, due to the presence of the dual carbonyl group in the molecule, effectively coordinates with Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, passivating the defects on both SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PVK layers.

Specifically, synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions, stabilized via interlayer exchange coupling in multilayer systems, achieve ultra-high motion speeds while eliminating the detrimental skyrmion Hall effect through topological charge compensation. Despite significant advancements in generating and manipulating SAF skyrmions, the controlled creation of individual skyrmions at predetermined locations and their reliable long-range transport remain challenging. In this study, we explore both the generation and motion dynamics of SAF skyrmions in Ta/[Pt/Co]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ru/[Co/Pt]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ta multilayer strips by current pulse excitation. By precisely controlling the amplitude and duration of the current pulses, as well as the external magnetic field strength, we generate skyrmions at defect sites and drive their depinning. Our results demonstrate that SAF skyrmions move along the strip with a Hall angle of 0.2°–0.9°. More importantly, under an optimal external magnetic field, SAF skyrmions can travel long distances—up to the full length of the strip. Furthermore, reversing the driving current causes the SAF skyrmion to reverse its motion direction, allowing for controllable, repeated bidirectional movement along the strip. These findings represent a significant step forward in the development of spintronic devices based on the controlled generation and long-range transport of SAF skyrmions.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252401/3375358/Current-induced-generation-and-long-distance</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Dislocations influence the background hole densities in Ge/Si virtual substrates</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251901/3375356/Dislocations-influence-the-background-hole</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;In this study, the interaction between extended defects and the electrical activity of Ge/Si (001) plastically relaxed epitaxial layers is examined.

Unlike conventional perovskite ferroelectrics, the ferroelectricity in monolayer CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; stems from spontaneous intra-cell polar distortions with negligible inter-dipole coupling. While antiferroelectric ordering emerges as the ground state, its thermal stability competes with scale-free and distorted ferroelectric configurations. We quantitatively clarify this mechanism through our modeling, demonstrating how the degeneracy of metastable states enables coexisting order parameters across multiple length scales. This work fundamentally distinguishes weak-correlation ferroelectricity from conventional cooperative mechanisms, offering promising design principles for nanoscale ferroelectric devices, with particular promise for high-density memory applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252901/3375352/Robust-local-dipole-and-weak-inter-dipole-coupling</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Failure of Hund’s J in Contemporary DFT+U+J: Insights from Spin-Crossover Fe(II) Complexes</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291/asset/images/medium/ct5c01291_0011.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01291</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Feature-Selective Preprocessing with Electrically Robust Boron Nitride-Based Dynamic Memristors for Reliable Lightweight Neural Networks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967/asset/images/medium/nn5c16967_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c16967&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:05:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Interpreting X-ray Diffraction Patterns of Metal–Organic Frameworks via Generative Artificial Intelligence</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c16416/asset/images/medium/ja5c16416_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c16416&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:03:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Free-energy perturbation in the exchange-correlation space accelerated by machine learning: application to silica polymorphs</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01874-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 20 December 2025;

The optimized Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4 achieves a Li+ conductivity of 1.16 × 10−5 S cm−1, two orders of magnitude higher than that of analogous Li2TiF6. Combining the inherent high-voltage stability of fluoride and the excellent ionic conductivity of Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4, this material enables superior 5 V-class all-solid-state battery performance. This work opens a new avenue for designing high-conductivity fluoride SSEs and advancing the performance of 5 V-class all-solid-state batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00414-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00298B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00298B, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Janghoon Ock,  Radheesh Sharma Meda, Tirtha  Vinchurkar, Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani&lt;br /&gt;Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis.

Baglioni et al. show that X-ray irradiation increases the enthalpy of chalcogenide glasses, amplifying the secondary Johari-Goldstein relaxation and reflecting enhanced defect-induced heterogeneity. These results establish X-ray irradiation as a precise tool to control structural heterogeneity and mechanical behavior, providing a versatile approach to designing glasses with tunable relaxation dynamics and tailored mechanical properties.</description><author>Newton</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

The bipolar photodetectors with polarity-switchable photoresponse take advantage of multi-dimensional signal recognition and signal processing efficiency. However, as-reported bipolar photodetectors are limited primarily to complex multi-layer heterojunction architectures based on either multi-wavelength absorption or a competitive photoresponse mechanism. The lack of a regulation scheme for implementing and optimizing polarity-switchable photoresponse of simple-structured GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based photodetectors becomes a bottleneck for friendly integration and efficient signal recognition. Herein, introducing a ferroelectric component endows amorphous GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/HZO) heterojunction photodetectors with programmable self-powered characteristics. The self-powered solar-blind photodetector (SSBPD) exhibits boosted polarity-switchable photoresponse by the coupling of ferro-pyro-phototronic effect. A switchover between positive to negative photoresponse is enabled by switching polarization from the upward state to the downward state. Photo-induced pyroelectric effect boosts bipolar photoresponse of the SSBPD characterized by four-stage photocurrent dynamic behavior. Under superposition contributions of programmable ferroelectric polarization and pyroelectric effect, the photoresponse enhancement factor of the SSBPD is 341% (226%) under upward (downward)-polarization state. Correspondingly, the maximum responsivity and detectivity are up to 0.26 mA/W and 4.47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, respectively. The SSBPD maintains excellent durability over a wide temperature range. Based on programmable bipolar photoresponse, a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/HZO photoelectric device displays application prospects in simulating a self-adaptive neuromorphic vision system and a nighttime anti-collision monitoring system. This work proposes a strategy to develop simple-architecture GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based bipolar photodetectors by multiple-effect coupling.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041422/3375099/Enabling-bipolar-photoresponse-improvement-of-a</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Here, we investigate croconic acid, a hydrogen-bonded organic ferroelectric, using real-time time-dependent density functional theory to uncover the microscopic mechanisms of light-induced structural transitions and nonlinear optical responses. High-order harmonic generation in croconic acid is found to be highly sensitive to proton displacement within hydrogen bonds, with polarization switching reshaping internal electronic asymmetry and modulating intersite electron currents. Subangstrom-scale lattice distortions induce marked enhancements or suppressions in the harmonics, highlighting the extreme sensitivity of the nonlinear response to hydrogen-bond configuration. These results reveal a light-driven electron–proton–lattice interaction mechanism in organic ferroelectrics, providing a route toward tunable ultrafast photonic and optoelectronic devices based on molecular materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/241102/3374918/Ultrafast-laser-induced-anharmonic-lattice</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Spin-splitting-torque-driven field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in RuO 2 /synthetic antiferromagnet heterostructures for spintronic convolutional neural networks</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/242405/3374916/Spin-splitting-torque-driven-field-free</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;With the growing demand for low-power and high-speed spintronic devices, the development of advanced material systems with efficient spin control capabilities has emerged as a central focus in spintronics research.

In a proof-of-concept demonstration, we showcase the implementation of an all-spintronic convolutional neural network using this architecture, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 98.7% on the handwritten digit classification task.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/242405/3374916/Spin-splitting-torque-driven-field-free</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] What Makes a Scent Trigger a Memory? A Cognitive Decomposition of Odor-Evoked Retrieval</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02728-2?rss=yes</link><description>A single scent can unlock vivid memories. This study investigates the factors that make some odors more evocative than others. We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes. Using machine learning with SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identified distinct predictors for each process.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02728-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Integrative Analysis of Transcriptomic Data Reveals a Predictive Gene Signature for Chemoradiotherapy Response in Rectal Cancer</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02716-6?rss=yes</link><description>Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), but only a minority of patients achieve a pathological complete response (pCR). Predictive biomarkers of response could help guide treatment decisions, yet none have reached clinical practice. In this exploratory study, we integrated six publicly available transcriptomic datasets and applied machine learning to derive a 186-gene signature predictive of nCRT response. The signature showed good performance in cross-validation (AUC 0.80) and was associated with consensus molecular (CMS4) and immune (iCMS3) subtypes enriched in responders.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02716-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Combining DNA Methylation Features and Clinical Characteristics Predicts Ketamine Treatment Response for PTSD</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02706-3?rss=yes</link><description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits extensive clinical and biological variability, making treatment challenging.

This study introduces a solvation regulation strategy that confines perovskite crystallization within localized solvent clusters during spray deposition. Such confined growth lowers the energy barrier for crystal formation, enabling uniform, defect-suppressed films even under high humidity. The approach allows for scalable fabrication of efficient perovskite optoelectronic devices with tunable thickness on arbitrary curved surfaces.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00409-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Anharmonic Coupling in a Strong Intramolecular H-Bond System: Contributions to Static and Time-Resolved Vibrational Spectra</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487/asset/images/medium/jz5c03487_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:03:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c03487</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Rhodium-Catalyzed Atroposelective Alkyne Oxyamidation Using Non-Nitrene NH Acyloxyamide Reagents</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18495</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18495/asset/images/medium/ja5c18495_0010.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18495&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18495</guid></item><item><title>[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Physical Sciences] CHARGE-MAP: An integrated framework to study the multicriteria EV charging infrastructure expansion problem</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2514184122?af=R</link><description>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 51, December 2025. &lt;br /&gt;SignificanceThe surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption has presented us the challenge of developing accessible and cost-effective charging infrastructures.

Two-dimensional M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MXenes are promising anode candidates due to their structural flexibility and low molar mass, yet their stability and storage mechanism remain unclear.

The storage mechanism involves covalent bonding between surface N and halide-ions, where adsorption strength is governed by the energy difference between occupied &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and unoccupied &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;π&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals and their electron overlap.

We propose a thermo-mechanical coupling framework for nanosecond laser ablation based on energy conservation, which is embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to enable simultaneous inversion of multiple mechanical properties. A thermo-mechanical coupling coefficient is defined to uniformly describe the dynamic allocation of input laser energy among thermal diffusion, mechanical work, and plasma shielding across different deformation stages under laser irradiation. Furthermore, hard-to-measure physical characteristics in the coupled equation are replaced with experimentally accessible features obtained through the simultaneous acquisition of spectroscopic, shockwave, and surface-wave signals. Using 210 experimental datasets, the framework simultaneously recovers Young's modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and micro-Vickers hardness with high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9927, 0.9912, 0.9916, and 0.9959, respectively), significantly outperforming the baseline method (ultrasonic velocity regression for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0012). Comparisons with linear normalization and unconstrained neural networks demonstrate that PINN achieves near-unity accuracy through the embedding of conservation-law constraints. Partial dependency analysis further uncovers the nonlinear coupling laws between input features and mechanical properties. The proposed paradigm, integrating conservation laws, measurable features, and physics-informed learning, offers a universal approach for non-contact, high-precision, and physically consistent multi-to-multi inversion of multiple material properties under nanosecond laser ablation conditions.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/244101/3374784/Measurement-of-multiple-mechanical-properties-from</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Deep learning based SEM image analysis for predicting ionic conductivity in LiZr2(PO4)3-based solid electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00232J" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00232J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kento Murakami, Yudai Yamaguchi, Yo Kato, Kazuki Ishikawa, Naoto Tanibata, Hayami Takeda, Masanobu Nakayama, Masayuki Karasuyama&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-ion-conductive oxide materials have attracted considerable attention as solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Hierarchical Attention Graph Learning with LLMs Enhancement for Molecular Solubility Prediction</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00407A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00407A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yangxin Fan, Yinghui  Wu, Roger French, Danny Perez, Michael Taylor, Ping Yang&lt;br /&gt;Solubility quantifies the concentration of a molecule that can dissolve in a given solvent.

Historically, manual inspections have been plagued by subjectivity, inefficiency, and restricted scalability, necessitating the development of enhanced detection algorithms. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing image processing and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and practical applicability. This strategy promotes classification stability by integrating machine learning classifiers, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, with fusion techniques such as Majority Voting and Mean Fusion. The experiments utilize Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for model evaluation to address dataset variability and deliver thorough assessments. The study’s results indicate that the suggested system surpasses existing systems in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, attaining an overall accuracy of 98.17%. The method is effective across various noise and resolution parameters, allowing for scalability in precision agriculture applications. This discovery not only enhances the diagnosis of plant nutrient deficiencies but also enables further investigations into real-time plant health monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046111/3374702/Smart-detection-of-plant-nutrient-deficiencies</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Machine Intelligence] LLM use in scholarly writing poses a provenance problem</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01159-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Machine Intelligence, Published online: 12 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01159-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42256-025-01159-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;LLM use in scholarly writing poses a provenance problem</description><author>Nature Machine Intelligence</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01159-8</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] PEMD: a high-throughput simulation and analysis framework for solid polymer electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00454C" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00454C, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shendong Tan, Bochun Liang, Dexin Lu, Chaoyuan Ji, Wenke Ji, Zihui Li, Tingzheng Hou&lt;br /&gt;PEMD is an open-source Python framework that integrates polymer construction, force-field parameterization, multiscale simulation, and property analysis, with standardized workflows for screening and data-driven design of solid polymer electrolytes.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Investigating CO adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) surfaces using machine learning exchange-correlation functionals</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</link><description>The ‘CO adsorption puzzle’, a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations in density functional theory to replicate CO’s experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn–Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06, and can be applied to study unseen adsorbate coverages. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Contextualized biomedical language processing enhances ICU survival prediction</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02703-8?rss=yes</link><description>Accurate prediction of intensive care unit (ICU) survival remains challenging due to heterogeneous clinical data.

This review examines the underlying mechanisms that facilitate these structural changes, the various types of stimuli capable of inducing them, and the wide-ranging applications that capitalize on these dynamic properties. The discussion elucidates that the flexibility inherent in MOFs derives from several factors, including the characteristics of the metal cluster, the coordination geometry, the rigidity or flexibility of the organic linkers, and the overall topology of the framework. It is emphasized that minor alterations in these molecular-level attributes can result in significant variations in the structural behavior of MOFs, encompassing phenomena such as breathing, gate opening, and both negative and positive thermal expansion. Moreover, the review explores the experimental and computational methodologies employed to investigate MOF flexibility, incorporating &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; characterization techniques and molecular modeling approaches. It highlights how the interplay between framework design, guest interactions, and defect engineering can be strategically utilized to develop stimuli-responsive MOFs with customized functionalities suitable for applications in areas such as gas separation, gas storage, and sensing. In conclusion, the review underscores the importance of comprehending and manipulating structural transformations in MOFs, a consideration that has emerged as a key element in contemporary materials science and engineering.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/120601/3374651/Structural-transformations-in-metal-organic</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A Physics Informed Model for the Prediction of Surface Energies and the Shape of Metal Particles</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02691-4?rss=yes</link><description>Surface energies of metal-based systems are important for determining the Wulff-constructed shapes of metal nanoparticles and understanding the stability. We have developed a physics informed method to predict the total energy of metal-based systems across a wide range of configurations. Our method has been tested against Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for late transition metals. This method enables on-the-fly surface energy predictions based on the fundamental of materials property and allows for the Wulff construction of metal particles for a random number of elemental atoms and without the need for DFT calculations.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02691-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Balanced DNA-to-Cytoplasm Ratio at the 2-Cell Stage Is Critical for Mouse Preimplantation Development</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02677-X?rss=yes</link><description>Among vertebrates, mammalian haploid embryos are highly prone to early developmental arrest for reasons that remain unclear. Using mouse preimplantation embryos with altered cell size and ploidy, we show that arrest primarily results from an imbalance between ploidy and cytoplasmic volume, rather than from haploidy itself.

These nanodevices exhibit near-linear long-term potentiation and long-term depression characteristics under repetitive voltage pulses, achieving a remarkable dynamic range. Simulations using a convolutional neural network model with these devices attain 95% recognition accuracy on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digits dataset within 100 epochs.

They can vary in nature, geometry, and size, ranging from microscopic-size defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twin planes, and oxygen vacancies, to macroscopic-size defects such as segregations, indentations, contamination, cracks, and voids. Irrespective of their type, defects perturb the flow of electric current, forcing it to deviate from its path. In the best-case scenario, the associated perturbation can be damped within a distance of the order of the size of the defect if the rigidity of the superconducting state, characterized by the creep exponent &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;, is low. In most cases, however, this perturbation spans macroscopic distances covering the entire superconducting sample and thus dramatically influences the response of the system. In this work, we review the current state of theoretical understanding and experimental evidence on the modification of magnetic flux patterns in superconductors by border defects, including the influence of their geometry, temperature, and applied magnetic field. We scrutinize and contrast the picture emerging from a continuous media standpoint, i.e., ignoring the granularity imposed by the vortex quantization, with that provided by a phenomenological approach dictated by the vortex dynamics. In addition, we discuss the influence of border indentations on the nucleation of thermomagnetic instabilities. Assessing the impact of surface and border defects is of utmost importance for all superconducting technologies, including resonators, single-photon detectors, radio frequency cavities and accelerators, cables, metamaterials, diodes, and many others.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041324/3374475/Impact-of-border-defects-on-the-magnetic-flux</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Quantifying Phase Contributions to Ion Transport in Organic–Inorganic Composite Electrolytes</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c11634</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c11634/asset/images/medium/ja5c11634_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c11634&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 19:45:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c11634</guid></item><item><title>[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents] Chatbot Voting Advice Applications inform but seldom sway young unaligned voters</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2515516122?af=R</link><description>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. &lt;br /&gt;SignificanceMany people struggle to identify where political parties stand on the issues that matter most to them.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films revealed the presence of Ga–Ga bonding and uncoordinated oxygen, indicating the coexistence of Ga interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Although Ga interstitials are known to be shallow donors, the presence of both types of donors prevents unambiguous assignment of the intrinsic n-type conductivity. XPS also confirmed Ga diffusion into the ITO contact upon annealing, consistent with the measured decrease in the Fermi level separation from the conduction band edge and an increase in free electron concentration. The results show that forming a mixed, defective ITO/Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer is crucial for reducing contact resistance and enhancing the ohmicity of ITO contacts to β-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Schematic energy band diagrams of the ohmic ITO/Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunctions are proposed.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/121105/3374160/UV-photoelectron-spectroscopy-of-band-alignment-at</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] PP2Acα regulates cerebellar development via phosphorylation-dependent neuronal programs</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02613-6?rss=yes</link><description>Cerebellar development requires precise control of phosphorylation, yet the contribution of protein phosphatases remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the function of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha (PP2Acα) in cerebellar granule neurons. Conditional deletion of Ppp2ca using Atoh1-Cre mice resulted in impaired motor coordination and cognitive performance, reflecting disrupted cerebellar development.

MRPARCv2 introduces hierarchical discretization and cross-resolution feature communication to improve the accuracy and efficiency of flow simulations. We evaluate the model on a challenging 2D turbulent radiative layer dataset from The Well multi-physics benchmark repository and demonstrate significant improvements when compared to the single resolution baseline model, in both Variance Scaled Root Mean Squared Error and physics-driven metrics, including turbulent kinetic energy spectra and mass–temperature distributions. Despite having 30% fewer trainable parameters, MRPARCv2 outperforms its predecessor by up to 50% in roll-out prediction error and 86% in spectral error. A preliminary study on uncertainty quantification was performed, and we also analyzed the model’s performance under different levels of abstractions of the flow, specifically on sampling subsets of field variables. We find that the absence of physical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) in the network architecture leads to degraded accuracy. A variable substitution experiment confirms that this issue persists regardless of which physical quantity is predicted directly. Our findings highlight the advantages of multi-resolution inductive bias for capturing multi-scale flow dynamics and suggest the need for future PIML models to embed EOS knowledge to enhance physical fidelity.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046110/3374061/Multi-resolution-physics-aware-recurrent</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Understanding and mitigating distribution shifts for universal machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00260E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00260E" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00260E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S.

Herein, we synthesized layered BiOI transparent single crystals through a tellurium-assisted chemical vapor transport strategy. Systematic investigation reveals that tellurium acts as a critical transport agent, directly modulating the crystallization dynamics and enabling the growth of high-quality 1-cm single crystals with precise size control. The layered BiOI crystals demonstrate excellent broadband (254–940 nm) photoresponse performance, achieving a remarkable responsivity of 123.7 A·W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and specific detectivity of 7.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Notably, the implementation of gate voltage regulation allows dynamic control of carrier transport mechanisms, achieving efficient regulation of the photoresponse of the device. This unique gate-tunable characteristic enables dual-mode operation in image recognition systems, simultaneously supporting both high-sensitivity detection and programmable contrast enhancement. The combination of scalable crystal growth and multifunctional optoelectronic properties positions BiOI as a promising candidate for next-generation intelligent photodetection

To address these challenges, recently, in Matter, Tian et al. proposed an innovative “pre-placed vacancy and isomorphous occupancy” strategy to prepare the first A-site high-entropy MAX phase. The entropy-induced lattice distortions and defects optimize impedance matching and enhance polarization loss, thus achieving exceptional microwave absorption. This work establishes A-site high-entropy engineering as a powerful approach to tailor MAX phases for next-generation microwave absorption materials.</description><author>Matter</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00601-0?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] Carrier dynamics: Key to blue perovskite light-emitting diodes</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00555-7?rss=yes</link><description>This review explores the underlying reasons for the suboptimal performance of blue light perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) and discusses potential improvement strategies, drawing on fundamental theories of carrier dynamics.

Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt;, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;LevelsExtractor&lt;/span&gt;, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;SourcesMapper&lt;/span&gt;, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046109/3373556/RTNinja-A-generalized-machine-learning-framework</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A pilot study: Incorporating Treponema pallidum antigens into machine learning models for accurate syphilis treatment outcome assessment</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</link><description>Health informatics; disease; artificial intelligence applications</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[APL Materials Current Issue] Erratum: “Growth of conductive Si-doped α-Ga 2 O 3  by suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy” [APL Mater. 13, 101117 (2025)]</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/129901/3373552/Erratum-Growth-of-conductive-Si-doped-Ga2O3-by</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;In our recently published paper,&lt;a class="reflinks" href="https://pubs.aip.org/rss/site_1000013/1000009.xml#c1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a reference was mistakenly cited as support for our hypothesis on p. 9 that Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; may be converting to Si&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and acting as a compensating defect in α-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Consequently, the use of oxygen-releasing osteogenic materials has been studied extensively in recent years. This study aimed to construct and test a 3D-printed composite scaffold with both angiogenic and bone-repair functions. A “sandwich”-like structure containing polycaprolactone, hydroxyapatite, and calcium peroxide was fabricated using fused deposition modeling 3D printing technology. The polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite/calcium peroxide composite scaffolds exhibited excellent mechanical properties and sustained oxygen release for over three weeks. Compared to the control groups, the polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite/calcium peroxide scaffolds also significantly promoted rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and osteogenic differentiation, with the scaffold containing 1% calcium peroxide showing the most potent pro-angiogenic and bone-repairing effects. In a rat calvarial defect model, radiographic and histological analyses revealed that the synergistic effects of calcium peroxide and hydroxyapatite significantly induced vascular network formation, accelerated bone regeneration across the entire defect area, and markedly enhanced new bone formation. In summary, this work proposes a novel strategy for fabricating cell- and growth factor-free bone tissue engineering scaffolds with potential for tissue regeneration and clinical replacement.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/121101/3373547/3D-printed-oxygen-releasing-scaffolds-promote-bone</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Bathymetry of the Philippine Sea with Convolution Neural Network from Multisource Marine Geodetic Data</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02546-5?rss=yes</link><description>This study developed a deep learning-based method for high resolution bathymetry prediction in the Philippine Sea, aiming to improve the accuracy of seafloor depth estimation using multi-source marine geodetic data.

We present the deterministic characterization with an integrated parallelizable hybrid resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10 kHz throughput with 168.3 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;s inference latency, indicating scalability to 14 kHz with field-programmable gate array integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals.

We create a database of all two-generated subgroups of the symmetric group on n-objects and conduct a classification of finite simple groups among them using shallow feed-forward neural networks. We show that this neural network classifier can decipher the property of simplicity with varying accuracies depending on the features. Our neural network model leads to a natural conjecture concerning the generators of a finite simple group. We subsequently prove this conjecture. This new toy theorem comments on the necessary properties of generators of finite simple groups. We show this explicitly for a class of sporadic groups for which the result holds. Our work further makes the case for a machine motivated study of algebraic structures in pure mathematics and highlights the possibility of generating new conjectures and theorems in mathematics with the aid of machine learning.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1d98</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

To address this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to dramatically boost the performance of red μ-LEDs. Our strategy involves integrating rod-shaped Au nanoparticles into a precisely engineered nanohole pattern. By strategically placing these nanoparticles, we optimize LSPR coupling with the active region of the μ-LEDs, resulting in significant enhancements in light extraction efficiency and reduced radiative recombination rates. Furthermore, we employ a chemical treatment to effectively passivate surface defects, minimizing non-radiative recombination losses. This synergistic approach leads to a substantial increase in both optical output and electroluminescence intensity, pushing the boundaries of red μ-LED performance. The nanohole-patterned μ-LED chips achieve a ∼2.32-fold higher optical output at 50 A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along with an ∼8.96-fold higher electroluminescence, compared to the bare μ-LEDs. A lower lifetime of 0.348 ns for the nanohole-patterned μ-LEDs elucidates the fundamental mechanism of the novel approach with a high energy-coupling efficiency (67%) of the multi-quantum wells through the fast LSP channel.

However, these advantages also introduce challenges in probing and controlling AFM order, thereby restricting their practical application. In this study, we demonstrate an all-electric control and probing of AFM order in heavy metal/AFM insulator heterostructures on a ferroelectric substrate at room temperature. The AFM order was detected by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and manipulated by the ferroelectric field effect as well as the piezoelectric effect in heterostructures of Pt/NiO/0.7Pb(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–0.3PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PMN–PT). The nonvolatile control of AFM order gives rise to a 33% modulation of AHE, which is further evidenced by synchrotron-based x-ray magnetic linear dichroism. Combined with the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; piezoelectric response of AHE, we demonstrate that the ferroelectric polarization contributes mainly to the control of AFM order. Our results are expected to have broader implications for efficient spintronic devices.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041410/3372820/Electrical-modulation-and-probing-of</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

This review explores the synergistic integration of metasurfaces—engineered sub-wavelength planar structures—and quantum optics, which exploits quantum mechanical principles to manipulate light at the most granular level. We outline the design principles, fabrication processes, and computational challenges involved in creating quantum metasurfaces, discussing both forward and inverse design approaches. Advances in nanofabrication and intelligent optimization techniques, such as machine learning and topology optimization, have enabled the development of metasurfaces with unparalleled control over electromagnetic waves. We examine recent progress in using quantum metasurfaces for single-photon and multi-photon generation, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing, showcasing how these innovations achieve unprecedented precision and novel functionalities. Additionally, we highlight the integration of metasurfaces into quantum light manipulation, emphasizing their role in enhancing wavefront shaping and entanglement control.

Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (3D) (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for 3D systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01–0.02 Å and errors in the energy below 10 meV atom−1 across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal MLIPs have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Conjugated polyelectrolyte-aptamer hybrid for organic-electrochemical-transistor-based sensing</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00564-8?rss=yes</link><description>Jiang et al. present biofunctionalized organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), specifically single-component materials that integrate high specificity with semiconducting properties, exemplified by p(NDI-T-ZI/EG)-aptamer.

However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model.

TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with its high stability and strong oxidation power, suffers from a wide bandgap that limits its visible-light absorption, whereas MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC), exhibits excellent catalytic properties and a narrow bandgap that enhances light absorption and charge transfer. The MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction effectively overcomes these limitations by facilitating charge separation, suppressing recombination losses, and expanding the light absorption range, making it a promising candidate for sustainable energy applications. Notably, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunctions have demonstrated versatility in PEC systems, functioning effectively as photoanodes and photocathodes. This review provides a detailed overview of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based PEC architectures, including a comparative analysis of their anodic and cathodic roles. Furthermore, recent advances in synthesis strategies, interfacial engineering, charge transfer mechanisms, and performance enhancement techniques have been discussed comprehensively. Additionally, challenges such as interfacial charge recombination, stability issues, and scalable fabrication methods are addressed along with emerging strategies, including defect engineering, plasmonic enhancement, and multi-component heterostructures. By addressing these challenges, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunctions hold great promise for the future of solar-driven hydrogen production and carbon capture technologies, contributing to global efforts toward clean energy and environmental sustainability.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041316/3371767/Advances-in-MoS2-TiO2-heterojunctions-for</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Surface stability modeling with universal machine learning interatomic potentials: a comprehensive cleavage energy benchmarking study</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1408</link><description>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory database of 36 718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our zero-shot evaluation results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10–100× computational speedup. These findings fundamentally reframe MLIP development priorities: highlighting that strategic training-data generation with appropriate non-equilibrium sampling deserves equal or greater attention than architectural complexity.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1408</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Li–Si compound anodes enabling high-performance all-solid-state Li-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</link><description>Li–Si compound anodes, exemplified by Li2.33Si, overcome the degradation issues of conventional Si anodes by combining high ionic and electronic conductivity, favorable mechanical properties, and a negligible-volume-change Li-storage mechanism (Li2.33 + αSi, 0 &lt; α &lt; 0.92), thereby enabling high areal capacity, long cycle life, and fast rate capability in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[APL Energy Current Issue] Tailoring ferroelectricity in Al:HfO 2  capacitors: A comprehensive approach to annealing, electrode selection, and Al dopant distribution</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/3/4/046104/3371306/Tailoring-ferroelectricity-in-Al-HfO2-capacitors-A</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;We systematically investigate the effects of annealing conditions, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycle number and distribution, and top electrode (TE) material on the ferroelectric switching behavior of 10 nm-thick Al-doped HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Al:HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) films. We perform 150 ALD cycles, comprising HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sub-cycles, with precise control over the number and distribution of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles. Post-metallization annealing (PMA) at 600 °C for 3 min induced spontaneous 2 remnant polarization (2P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) through the combined Al-induced lattice stress and TE-induced mechanical stress, promoting orthorhombic phase formation. Optimization to three Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cycles within the HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bulk balances polarization enhancement and suppression of oxygen-vacancy-induced leakage, yielding a 2P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and endurance up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cycles. The W electrodes, with a low thermal expansion coefficient and smooth surfaces, enable uniform stress transfer and improved dipole alignment compared to Mo and Ru electrodes. Notably, asymmetric localization of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sub-cycles near the lower HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; region, combined with TE-induced stress, maximizes uniform stress distribution across the film. As confirmed by positive-up-negative-down measurements, this mechanism activates a higher dipole density and achieves the highest 2P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = ∼9 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; without additional leakage.

Conventional techniques are mostly invasive, time-consuming, expensive, sophisticated, and centered at urban facilities. Moreover, they are unable to address the biological complexities related to critical diseases, disorders, and pandemics, resulting in associated high morbidity and mortality. To address this gap, miniaturized fifth-generation sensing chips provide alternatives in terms of accessibility, affordability, and adaptability, being point-of-care and minimally invasive diagnostics. In this context, Breathomic chips based on nanoscale semiconductors have shown their potential for noninvasive, personalized, and on-site operation, offering the capability to identify volatile organic compounds/gases as disease biomarkers from exhaled breath and enabling early disease detection. However, the practical implementation of these sensors in real-time medical contexts remains challenging due to factors including the lack of clinical trials, dedicated data analysis, understanding of the complexities, public awareness, scalability, and accessibility. This comprehensive review critically summarizes the landscape of breath biomarkers detecting fifth-generation chemiresistive chips for human disease diagnosis, methodically outlining associated challenges, alternative strategies, and prospects for clinical implementations and commercial advancement. It details the biological origins of biomarkers, the diverse sensing modalities, and the underlying mechanisms pertaining to breathomic biomarker diagnosis. Furthermore, it highlights the integration of digital-age technologies, including nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and machine learning, for high-performance breathomic chips. These next-generation smart sensory chips have the potential to revolutionize medical healthcare facilities, improving patient outcomes, understanding prognosis, and aiding the UN's sustainable development goals.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041311/3371043/Dynamic-landscape-of-chemiresistive-breathomic</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Machine learning of polyurethane prepolymer viscosity: a comparison of chemical and physicochemical approaches</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00287G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00287G" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3652-3661&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00287G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Joseph A.

To address this gap, we introduce an affordable, autonomous, Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled experimental platform designed specifically for applied physics education. Utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, a customizable multi-wavelength light emitting diode array, and photosensors, our setup generates diverse, real-time optical datasets ideal for training and evaluating foundational ML algorithms, including traversal methods, Bayesian inference, and deep learning. The platform facilitates a closed-loop, self-driving experimental workflow, encompassing automated data collection, preprocessing, model training, and validation. Through systematic performance comparisons, we demonstrate the superior ability of deep learning to capture complex nonlinear relationships compared to traversal and Bayesian methods.

Yet, their success depends on robust data integration and fusion methods capable of handling materials data that are heterogeneous, sparse, and multi-scale. Such data span theoretical models, simulations, and experimental techniques across diverse spatial and temporal scales, creating significant challenges for interoperability and analysis. This perspective reviews the state-of-the-art techniques, including knowledge graphs, structured pipelines, multimodal machine learning, and physics-informed models, that are enabling materials science and SDLs to unify and learn from disparate data sources, identify critical challenges, and propose forward-looking directions to enhance data readiness, interoperability, and predictive power in SDLs. We also highlight emerging methods such as transformer architectures, zero-shot learning, and real-time stream processing, and discuss the critical need for more scalable, interpretable, and adaptive solutions to fully realize autonomous materials innovation. By mapping out both the current landscape and future opportunities, we argue that next-generation data integration and fusion are not just enablers but essential pillars for achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and intelligent SDL systems capable of addressing the complexities of hierarchical and multifunctional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/040901/3369947/Data-integration-and-data-fusion-approaches-in</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Machine learning anomaly detection of automated HPLC experiments in the cloud laboratory</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00253B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00253B" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3445-3454&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00253B, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Filipp Gusev, Benjamin C.

However, conventional approaches rely primarily on chemical and electrical doping and focus mainly on local electrical or optical measurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain. Magneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated modulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical measurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and ferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically coupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime. This study establishes strain engineering as a promising platform for tuning vHss and resultant itinerant ferromagnetism of low-dimensional correlated quantum systems.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041406/3369932/Strain-engineering-of-van-Hove-singularity-and</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Machine Learning‐Enhanced Random Matrix Theory Design for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Vaccine Development</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500124?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 03:21:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500124</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] An improved machine learning strategy using structural features to predict the glass transition temperature of oxide glasses</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00326A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00326A" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3764-3773&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00326A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Satwinder Singh Danewalia, Kulvir Singh&lt;br /&gt;We present a physics-informed machine learning approach to predict the glass transition temperature (&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) of sodium borosilicate glasses.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00326A</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] 3D-printed lithium-metal batteries: Multiscale architectures, hybrid technologies, and monolithic integration for next-generation energy storage</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041310/3369005/3D-printed-lithium-metal-batteries-Multiscale</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Lithium-metal anodes, with their unmatched theoretical capacity (3860 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultra-low electrochemical potential (−3.04 V vs standard hydrogen electrode), are pivotal for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. However, their practical deployment is hindered by persistent challenges—dendritic growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), and severe volumetric expansion. Emerging as a transformative solution, three-dimensional (3D) printing enables the rational design of multiscale architectures (e.g., micro-lattice anodes and gradient-porous cathodes) and hybrid solid-state electrolytes to address these limitations. This review presents a pioneering synthesis of 3D printing's role in lithium-metal battery engineering, focusing on its capacity to regulate lithium-ion flux, stabilize SEIs, and suppress dendrite proliferation through hierarchical structural control. We systematically analyze four key additive manufacturing technologies (inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and stereolithography), delineating their unique advantages in tailoring ion transport pathways and mechanical robustness. Furthermore, we propose multi-material co-printing strategies to resolve interfacial incompatibilities in monolithic lithium-metal batteries, a critical barrier in current research. By bridging additive manufacturing with electrochemical fundamentals, this work outlines a roadmap to harness 3D printing's full potential, addressing scalability challenges and advancing applications in aerospace, wearables, and biomedical devices where energy density and safety are paramount.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041310/3369005/3D-printed-lithium-metal-batteries-Multiscale</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Harnessing Large Language Models to Advance Microbiome Research: From Sequence Analysis to Clinical Applications</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500038?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500038</guid></item><item><title>[Newton] Mapping the three-dimensional structure of faceted gold mesocrystals using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging</title><link>https://www.cell.com/newton/fulltext/S2950-6360(25)00261-0?rss=yes</link><description>Understanding the structure-property relationship of self-assembled superstructures requires non-destructive 3D structural analysis, which can then facilitate the development of mesocrystals with collective and emergent properties.

The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form being used as independent loss components (here , where n is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant ). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, , for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian J. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1117</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] SpectroGen: A physically informed generative artificial intelligence for accelerated cross-modality spectroscopic materials characterization</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00477-1?rss=yes</link><description>SpectroGen seamlessly couples physics-driven distribution models with a variable autoencoder to generate synthetic spectra indistinguishable from real data.

In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041305/3366934/The-enduring-legacy-of-scanning-spreading</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: InfoMat: Table of Contents] Multi‐defect‐engineering in ZnO/GO heterostructures for optoelectronic synaptic devices with ultra‐high dynamic range and low energy consumption</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/inf2.70089?af=R</link><description>InfoMat, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: InfoMat: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 16:00:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/inf2.70089</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Oxygen Vacancy-Modulated Molybdenum Oxide/Montmorillonite Heterointerface Nanoarchitectures for Plasmon-Enhanced Solar-Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/762823f9-fd0a-4aff-acde-289220f569a8/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132&lt;/div&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes with precise ion transport kinetics hold transformative potential for next-generation ion-selective membranes, yet their practical implementation in osmotic energy conversion remains constrained by inherent ...</description><author>Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Constructing and explaining machine learning models for the exploration and design of boron-based Lewis acids</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00212E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00212E" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3623-3634&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00212E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Juliette Fenogli, Laurence Grimaud, Rodolphe Vuilleumier&lt;br /&gt;Bridging ML and chemical intuition, interpretable models predict Lewis acidity with high accuracy and reveal design rules for tailoring boron-based Lewis acids.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00212E</guid></item><item><title>[APL Machine Learning Current Issue] Deep learning model of myofilament cooperative activation and cross-bridge cycling in cardiac muscle</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046101/3365811/Deep-learning-model-of-myofilament-cooperative</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Cardiac muscle contraction is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, where myosin heads generate force by cyclically attaching to and pulling on actin filaments using energy from ATP. Modeling this process is central to understanding cardiac sarcomere mechanics. In this study, we developed supervised machine learning (ML) models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate cross-bridge cycling and muscle behavior under isosarcometric, isometric, and isotonic conditions. Trained on synthetic data, the ANN captured nonlinear dependencies among calcium concentration, stiffness, sarcomere length, temperature, and force output. Error analysis through histograms and unity-line scatterplots validated prediction accuracy and identified underfitting and overfitting patterns. Comparisons across ANN architectures showed how hidden layer complexity affects model generalization. The present deep learning models accurately reproduced key physiological behaviors, including steady-state force–Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; relations, sarcomere length changes, and force–velocity relations, and matched theoretical results.

These natural carriers deliver various molecules into cells, including proteins and nucleic acids. There are numerous methods to load and modify EVs, encompassing physical, chemical, and biological approaches. EVs demonstrate the capacity to target specific cells within organs, even requiring blood–tissue transition. The protein corona significantly influences EV availability and cargo delivery, with biomolecules residing both within and conjugated to the EV membrane. Furthermore, embedding EVs within biomaterials such as hydrogels, scaffolds, and nanofibers can enhance their stability, targeting specificity, and therapeutic potential. By addressing cargo loading and cell/tissue-specific targeting, EVs offer a novel therapeutic strategy for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, EVs show promise as vaccination tools, delivering messenger RNA and proteins of various pathogens. Advances in EV biology and engineering would provide improved strategies for vesicle targeting, enhanced cargo loading, and safe and effective delivery.

Although disclination states of topological crystalline insulators have been extensively explored in wave systems, i.e., electromagnetic and acoustic wave systems, their experimental realizations in the diffusion process, particularly thermal diffusion, have remained underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, we theoretically model and experimentally measure topologically protected disclination states in C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric thermal crystalline lattices composed of aluminum disks. The temperature evolution is tied to an effective Hamiltonian hosting topological disclination modes, which have a diffusion rate that is robust against defects. Our findings extend topological disclination phases and the physics of fractional charges from Hermitian to anti-Hermitian systems, opening new avenues for future research in thermal information processing and temperature management processes that are robust against disturbances.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041401/3365605/Topological-thermal-crystalline-insulators</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Discovery of Novel Materials with Giant Dielectric Constants via First‐Principles Phonon Calculations and Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500141?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 06:30:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500141</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] FastTrack: a fast method to evaluate mass transport in solid leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potential</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae0808</link><description>We introduce a rapid, accurate framework for computing atomic migration barriers in crystals by combining universal machine‐learning force fields (MLFFs) with 3D potential‐energy‐surface sampling and interpolation.

For a benchmark set of twelve electrode and electrolyte materials, including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li10GeP2S12, our MLFF‐derived barriers lie within tens of meV of density functional theory (DFT) and experiment values, while achieving a ∼100-fold speedup over standard DFT‐NEB calculations. We benchmark GPTFF, CHGNet, and MACE, showing that fine‐tuning on PBE/PBE + U data further enhances accuracy.

While traditional mechanical exfoliation methods can produce high-quality flakes, they suffer from poor reproducibility and low yield. In recent years, metal-assisted exfoliation techniques have significantly improved monolayer yield and structural uniformity. Furthermore, scalable transfer strategies such as polyvinyl alcohol-assisted transfer and van der Waals integration have achieved cleaner interfaces and higher alignment accuracy. However, manual operation remains a major limitation to consistency and efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative tool, enabling intelligent control of the exfoliation and transfer process through real-time parameter optimization, crack prevention, and path planning. Deep learning architectures facilitate layer identification and defect detection, while reinforcement learning enables high-precision autonomous robotic manipulation. This article systematically reviews the latest advances in the field of 2D material exfoliation and transfer, highlighting the important role of AI in addressing core process bottlenecks and enabling the scalable, reliable, and automated fabrication of 2D materials.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae0353</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] 4D-MISR: a unified model for low-dose super-resolution imaging via feature fusion</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae05b6</link><description>While an electron microscope offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into structure–property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of the conventional method by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution that had been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances this reconstruction with a convolutional neural network that integrates features from synthetic, multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic evaluations on representative materials demonstrate the comparable spatial resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra low-dose conditions. Our work one-step expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable method for the structural analysis of any radiation-vulnerable material.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae05b6</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] 3D-printed scaffold loaded baicalin-preconditioned exosomes promote bone defect repair via mediating PRRX2 to alleviate inflammation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01826-7?rss=yes</link><description>Chronic nonunion of bone defects remains a significant challenge in orthopedic treatment.

These findings expand the synthetic repertoire for bioactive glycomimetics and provide new mechanistic insights into NHPI ester activation in cross-coupling chemistry.</description><author>Chem</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(25)00304-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] CGformer: Transformer-enhanced crystal graph network with global attention for material property prediction</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00423-0?rss=yes</link><description>Designing new materials for better batteries is a major challenge, especially for complex “high-entropy” materials with countless atomic combinations. We developed a novel AI model, CGformer, that looks at the entire crystal structure to accurately predict material properties. By screening nearly 150,000 candidates, our AI identified promising new sodium-ion solid electrolytes. We successfully synthesized these materials, and they showed excellent performance, validating our AI-driven discovery pipeline. This work provides a powerful tool to accelerate the design of next-generation energy materials.</description><author>Matter</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00423-0?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Chem] Organosilicon precursors for efficient aromatic copper-mediated radiocyanation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(25)00298-0?rss=yes</link><description>We present a copper-mediated labeling of aryl silanes with carbon-11, a radioactive isotope used in positron emission tomography imaging.

In this work, we developed a “pre-placed vacancy and isomorphous occupancy” strategy to synthesize the first A-site high-entropy (HE) MAX phase. The HE engineering induces lattice distortions and defects that simultaneously optimize impedance matching and create multiple polarization loss mechanisms, resulting in exceptional microwave absorption performance.

Such devices are useful if the magnetization can be manipulated electrically rather than by magnetic fields. This review covers the materials, underlying physics, and applications involved in such manipulation, focusing on two control mechanisms. The first is control by manipulating the magnetization through its coupling to ferroelectric order and the second is control by spin-polarized currents manipulating the magnetization through the angular momentum flowing into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/RevModPhys.96.015005.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Rev.

A historical introduction and a primer on the concepts of topology are followed by a discussion of experimental and theoretical methods that elucidate the exotic textures that appear in polar oxide nanostructures and superlattices. The complex interplay of several fundamental processes occurring on different energy scales leads to ground states that compete with one another and have large and/or novel responses with respect to external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/RevModPhys.95.025001.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Rev.
